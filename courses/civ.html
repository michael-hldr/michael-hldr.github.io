    <p>
        This page (which may become a few pages) is currently a work in progress. 
        It may take a long time to complete due to other committments and projects 
        (including midterms).
    </p>
    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
    <p>
        If you are studying any kind of engineering at the University of Toronto, you will 
        take a statics course during your first semester: Either CIV100 (Core 8) or CIV102 (EngSci). 
        This page is meant to contain parts of all structural courses up to at least second-year 
        Civil Engineering and may be expanded in the future as I see fit.<br/><br/>

        To ensure this page remains useful for all, I will specify which courses cover 
        each concept I cover. They are in chronological order for CIV100 and other courses 
        Civil Engineering students take. I do not know the EngSci order that well. 
        Before doing statics, you should be familiar with dynamics concepts 
        taught in high school, especially forces and spring motion. Statics courses assume 
        a good understanding of the dynamics content in SPH3U and SPH4U. Some concepts in later 
        sections will also require calculus knowledge (though not in CIV100).<br/><br/>
        
        Statics starts with a simple idea: A stable structure must be in equilibrium, 
        i.e. \(\Sigma F = 0\). Since force is a vector, this must be true in all directions. In both 
        CIV100 and CIV102, we look at this in 2D. In CIV100, we look at it in 3D as well (I do not 
        believe CIV102 looks at it in 3D). Since we are attempting to find how a resultant force is 
        equal to 0, it is important to know how to find a resultant force.
        <br/><br/>
    </p>
    <h2>Vectors & Resultant forces (High School Review for CIV100 & CIV102)</h2>
    <p>
        If you are comfortable with vector addition, you can skip to the next section.<br/><br/>

        There are two methods of vector addition: law of cosines and using components. Law of 
        cosines treats the two vectors, positioned head to tail, and the resultant as three edges 
        of a triangle as shown below. If you have the magnitudes of each vector and the angle 
        \(\theta\), you can use cosine law to find the magnitude of the resultant. Using components, 
        you split the vectors into each of their x and y components and add each of them together 
        to find the x and y components, as shown below.

        A couple quick practice problems. These are very easy and should just be a confirmation of 
        your understanding:<br/>
        1. If \(\vec v_1\) and \(\vec v_2 \) are attached tail-to-tail with an angle of \(30\) 
        degrees and magnitudes of \(3\) and \(5\), respectively, what is the magnitude of 
        \(\vec v_1 + \vec v_2\)? What is the angle between \(\vec v_1 + \vec v_2\) and 
        \(\vec v_1\) when the two vectors are placed tail-to-tail?<br/>
        2. If \(\vec v_1 = (1, 2)\), \(\vec v_2 = (4, -3)\), and \(\vec v_3 = (-1, 6)\), find 
        \(\vec v_1 + 6\vec v_2 - 3\vec v_3\).
