<h1>Courses</h1>
<p>
    I am compiling some of my thoughts on various courses I have taken at UofT Engineering. 
    The list will be expanded as I look into more courses.<br/><br/>
</p>
<h2>APS112</h2>
<p>
    See the <a href="/courses/ESP">ESP page</a> for more information.<br/>
</p>
<h2>Calculus</h2>

    Prof. Camelia Karimianpour was the course coordinator for MAT187 when I took it, so the course structure was 
    similar to MAT188 with the standards-based grading removed. I have heard negative opinions 
    about the new coordinator, and I would advise you spend a good amount of time reviewing 
    the textbook and other materials if possible to ensure you get the concepts.
</p>
<h2>CIV100, CIV102, and other structural courses</h2>
<p>
    These courses require a decent amount of practice. The practice problems are very good at getting 
    you to understand the concepts so you may screw yourself over if you cheat on the assignments. These 
    assignments take time and you have a week to do them, so set aside some time every week if you are worried 
    you will not get time to finish them. Paying attention in class is also sometimes important, and I learned 
    that the hard way in CME270. However, if you do not pay attention in class or just want to learn ahead, there 
    are plenty of <a href="./civ/index.html#resources">resources</a> available online. I am currently working on 
    my own text resource.
