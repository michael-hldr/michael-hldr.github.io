<h1>Courses</h1>
<p>
    I am compiling some of my thoughts on various courses I have taken at UofT Engineering. 
    The list is currently incomplete (as are the two pages listed) and 
    will be expanded as I look into more courses.<br/><br/>
</p>
<h2>APS112</h2>
<p>
    See the <a href="/courses/ESP">ESP page</a> for more information.<br/>
</p>
<h2>Calculus</h2>
<p>
    Avoid using the textbook problems when studying for exams. The OpenStax textbook mainly has 
    procedural problems, similar to WeBWorK problems. While they are good at getting you to 
    understand how to do the math yourself, they will not help you solve any word problems, which 
    are much more important in engineering than simply doing the math.<br/><br/>
    This is the advice we were given in Winter 2024.
