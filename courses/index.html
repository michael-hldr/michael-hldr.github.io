<h1>Courses</h1>
<p>
    I am compiling some of my thoughts on various courses I have taken at UofT Engineering. They are accurate as 
    of the 2024-25 academic year and may be out of date if a course is restructured or a course coordinator is 
    changed. The list will be expanded as I look into more courses.<br/><br/>
</p>
<h2>APS110</h2>
<p>
    The textbook is quite useful, but the practice problems there are not great. When studying, please look at 
    past exams when possible as well as your assignments and quizzes. The textbook does not have some of the 
    longer calculation problems you might find on exams.
</p>
<h2>APS111/112</h2>
<p>
    Engineering Strategies & Practice (ESP) is a learning curve. I started my 1F term performing 
    very poorly in APS111, especially compared to my other courses. However, one can make a comeback in ESP as 
    I did in APS111.<br/><br/>
    
    In early October, you will be placed in a group of approximately six people with which you will work on a 
    design project. You might not like the project, and that's okay. Most people will likely agree with you. It 
    is the design process you learn that matters most. You may be put in a bad group or have a hard TA or 
    CI. Having any of those will not prevent you from passing the course, but it may prevent you from achieving 
    the mark you want. There are ways to partly remedy bad groups: Internal deadlines are one I would recommend. 
    However, you will need to actively check your group's work after the internal deadline if you want to 
    take this route. That will ensure you catch the most painful mistakes and see who might be making them.<br/><br/>

    APS112 will have a similar design project, except you'll only be sharing each design project with two or 
    three other groups. Getting a bad project may demotivate you (especially if you lack interest or it makes 
    research more difficult), but otherwise I think the impact of one is less bad than the 2T8s I know think it 
    is.<br/><br/>

    See the <a href="/courses/ESP">ESP page</a> for more information about APS112.<br/>
</p>
<h2>Calculus (MAT186 and MAT187)</h2>
<p>
    If you are looking for <a href="/courses/calc/asymptote.html">
        my page on vertical asymptotes, click here
    </a>. If you are looking for <a href="/courses/calc/midterm-2.html">
        my page on Midterm 2, click here
    </a><br/><br/>

    I strongly recommend you take 
    <a href="https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/first-year-office-2/first-year-updates-deadlines/early-start-courses/">
        APS162
    </a> in the summer before first year and take APS163 during the fall if you can. As of the 2024-25 
    academic year, they are currently run better and in the event you are doing poorly (before the 
    drop deadline), you can drop the course and take it the following semester. Completing APS162 also gives 
    you the opportunity to either have a smaller work load for a semester in first year or to take an additional 
    elective course, which can be used to help satisfy your CS/HSS requirements. Registration for APS162 opens 
    in early June and the course fills up quickly.<br/><br/>

    If you believe in September that MAT187 will be more well-run than APS163 (or have similar feelings regarding 
    APS162), keep in mind that course coordinators can be switched. In October 2024, Prof. Camelia Karimianpour 
    was replaced as coordinator by Prof. Jason Siefken, who is unpopular among the 2T8s I have heard from. Thus, 
    do not assume MAT187 will be better. Only drop APS163 if you are doing poorly in that course.<br/><br/>

    If you are taking MAT187, spend a good amount of time reviewing the textbook and other materials if 
    possible to ensure you understand the concepts. I will update this page in the event the 
    coordinator changes again.
</p>
<h2>CIV100, CIV102, and other structural courses</h2>
<p>
    These courses require a decent amount of practice. The practice problems are very good at getting 
    you to understand the concepts so you may screw yourself over if you cheat on the assignments. These 
    assignments take time and you have a week to do them, so set aside some time every week if you are worried 
    you will not get time to finish them. Paying attention in class is also sometimes important, and I learned 
    that the hard way in CME270. However, if you do not pay attention in class or just want to learn ahead, there 
    are plenty of <a href="./civ/index.html#resources">resources</a> available online. I am currently working on 
    my own text resource.
    <br/><br/>
</p>
<h2>Linear Algebra (MAT188)</h2>
<p>
    This course has a lot of free marks because of the use of standards-based grading and the dropping of your 
    six lowest pre-class essentials marks. To get them, ensure you are caught up with the course material. 
    These grades are worth 29% of your final mark, almost as much as the final exam (35%). I am aware Linear 
    Algebra is difficult for some, but I believe the point of these free marks is to ensure you are 
    spending enough time on the course to understand the material.
</p>
<h2>APS105/106</h2>
<p>
    The people familiar with programming will find the midterm(s) easy and you will probably not need to spend 
    much time on the course. If you are taking APS105, the final exam will be significantly more harshly graded 
    than an easy midterm as the teaching team would like the course average to be a B-.
</p>
<h2>CHE112</h2>
<p>
    Chemistry generally requires a lot of effort and you will spend a lot of your time in this class. I was able 
    to save some time thanks to prior knowledge taking AP Chemistry the previous year. The term tests in the 
    course are quite difficult, though in 2024-25 (when they began having two midterms instead of one) students 
    performed significantly better in midterm 1. You can choose your lab groups, but you might need to choose 
    within your tutorial.
</p>
<h2>CIV185</h2>
<p>
    CIV185 has open-book tests. However, the tests were difficult as most did not understand the content that well. 
    The slideshows are usually very long and if you are not great at memorization you will struggle with them, 
    especially for the rocks portion of the course.
