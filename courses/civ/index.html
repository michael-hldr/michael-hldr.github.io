    <h1>CIV Courses</h1>
    <p>
        This part of my website is currently a work in progress. 
        It may take a long time to complete.<br/><br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Welcome to UofT Engineering! If you are studying any kind of engineering at the University of Toronto, you will 
        take a statics course during your first semester: Either CIV100 (Core 8) or CIV102 (EngSci). 
        This is meant to contain parts of all structural courses up to at least second-year 
        Civil Engineering and may be expanded in the future as I see fit.<br/><br/>

        To ensure this page remains useful for all, I will specify which courses cover 
        each concept I cover. They are in chronological order for CIV100 and other courses 
        Civil Engineering students take. I do not know the EngSci order that well. 
        Before doing statics, you should be familiar with dynamics concepts 
        taught in high school, especially forces and spring motion. Statics courses assume 
        a good understanding of the dynamics content in SPH3U and SPH4U. Some concepts in later 
        sections will also require calculus knowledge (though not in CIV100).<br/><br/>
        
        Statics starts with a simple idea: A stable structure must be in equilibrium, 
        i.e. \(\Sigma F = 0\). Since force is a vector, this must be true in all directions. In both 
        CIV100 and CIV102, we look at this in 2D. In CIV100, we look at it in 3D as well (I do not 
        believe CIV102 looks at it in 3D). Since we are attempting to find how a resultant force is 
        equal to 0, it is important to know how to find a resultant force.

        \[M = Fd\sin(\theta)\]
        \[\Sigma M = 0\]
        \[r = 3n\]
        \[r > 3n\]
        \[x^4 - 3x^2 + 1 \]
        \[\int(x^4 - 3x^2 + 1)\textnormal{d} x = \frac{x^5}{5} - x^3 + x + C\]
        \[\int \frac{M(x)}{EI} \textnormal{d}x \]
