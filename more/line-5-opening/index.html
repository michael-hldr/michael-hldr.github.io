    <h1>Line 5 Eglinton</h1>
    <p>
        If you want specific information about the schedule, see <a href="./schedule-note.txt">this page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Line 5 Eglinton will open on February 8, 2026. The schedule files for the line were released today, and 
        they show a 52-minute end-to-end travel time. Each section of the line runs as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        9-10 min. from Mt Dennis to Cedarvale (4.3 km; 26-29 km/h)<br/>
        9 min. from Cedarvale to Yonge (3.1 km; 21 km/h)<br/>
        12-13 min. from Yonge to Don Mills (5.0 km; 23-25 km/h)<br/>
        21 min. from Don Mills to Kennedy (6.2 km; 18 km/h)
    </p>
    <p>
        All speeds noted above are faster than the schedule for Line 6 Finch West, which was 46 minutes for a 
        10.5-km line (~14 km/h). The speeds are averages, meaning they include time when trains are stopped. 
        Tunnel speeds are noted to be maxxed at 60 km/h, with 80 km/h being allowed at the end of March.
    </p>
    <p>
        Trips will not be faster than Lines 1/2 if travelling from Kennedy to Cedarvale, or Line 2 and the Kitchener 
        Line/UP Express from Kennedy to Mount Dennis. However, Line 5 is faster than other transit options for 
        all trips between other pairs of stations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Service frequencies will mostly be satisfactory, ranging generally from 4 to 7 1/2 minutes. The only major issue 
        I forsee is early morning service, which westbound is every ~20 minutes for the first three trips. Given 
        each trip takes almost an hour (and the first trip starts at 5:40), this may mean 20-minute service is seen 
        well over an hour after service starts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Last trips will depart both ends around 10:57-58 p.m., later than Line 6. This means trains will be 
        running on most of the line well into the 11 p.m. hour. Like Line 6, this is temporary as part of the 
        plan for phased openings of new lines.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am optimistic for this line. The speeds appear much faster than Line 6. The eastern 
        section will serve as a good alternative to Line 2 during closures. The underground 
        section will be much faster than a surface LRT. However, I am aware that 
        things can and do go wrong and so I expect that to happen, especially for such a complex project.
