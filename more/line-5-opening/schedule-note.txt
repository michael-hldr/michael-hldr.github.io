Line 5 Eglinton

NOTE: A previous version of this page over-estimated the time taken by the shuttle bus. It is 53-58 min., rather than 60-69 min. I also neglected to include the Holiday service, which is different from Sunday service.

52 minutes end-to-end (both directions). The speeds below are averages, including layover time. Any train will spend time stopping which will naturally lower the speed. Actual train speeds will be higher.

9-10 min. Mt Dennis to Cedarvale (4.3 km; 26-29 km/h)
9 min. Cedarvale to Yonge (3.1 km; 21 km/h)
12-13. min Yonge to Don Mills (5.0 km; 23-25 km/h)
21 min. Don Mills to Kennedy (6.2 km; 18 km/h)

Trips from Kennedy to Cedarvale, and from Kennedy to Mount Dennis are expected to take approximately as long as other transit options (with the Mount Dennis Option requiring use of GO and/or UP services). For other journeys, Line 5 is expected to be the best option. All sections appear faster than Line 6 Finch West (scheduled at ~14 km/h upon opening).


Service frequency: 

Early morning: Inconsistent. Longest headways found were 12 min. eastbound and 20 min. westbound.
AM Peak: 4 min. 05 sec.
Mid-day: 7 min. 36 sec.
PM Peak: 4 min. 14 sec.
Early Evening: 6 min. 21 sec.
Late Evening: 7 min. 36 sec. (starting around 9:15 p.m. from Mount Dennis EB, after 10 p.m. WB. Last couple trips may have slightly longer gaps.)

Weekends: All 7 min. 36 sec., apart from the early morning issue mentioned above, which may impact trips for the first one to two hours of service.

Holidays:
Early morning: Inconsistent. WB service will be around 21 1/2 minutes for the first four trips. EB service will be every 10 minutes or better.
Morning: 9 min. 30 sec.
Afternoon: 7 min. 36 sec.
Early Evening: 12 min. 40 sec.

Last trains around 10:57-58 p.m.

The 20 min. service affects service starting between 5:40 (first trip) and 6:20, which arrive at Mount Dennis between 6:32 and 7:12. On Sundays, this is also the first few trips.
The 34 Eglinton will run as a local alternative in the area. It will be significantly slower (typically taking over an hour for the route).
The late evening shuttle bus will take 53-58 minutes according to the schedule, slightly slower than the LRT.
