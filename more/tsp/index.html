<h1>Understanding Transit Signal Priority (TSP)</h1>
<p>
    Following the poor reception of the recently-opened Line 6 Finch West, improved Transit Signal Priority (TSP) 
    has been presented as a way to improve speeds on the line particularly given (as of Dec. 2025) Line 6 vehicles typically 
    wait for left-turning cars before being given a green light. I appreciate the increased attention and hope it leads to 
    speed improvements for all transit in the near future, but we must ensure we are doing it right. TSP is much more 
    complicated than I have seen discussed over the past month. Luckily, I have looked into research on TSP as part of the 
    University of Toronto Transportation Alumni Network 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/university-of-toronto-transportation-alumni-network_uttan-is-proud-to-present-the-2025-student-activity-7373483259982430208-t3E3">

<h2>"Passive" and "Active" TSP</h2>
<p>
    TSP encompasses any modifications to traffic signals that advantage transit over other modes. Thus, the most simple things 
    can be counted as TSP. Passive TSP is anything that does not require vehicle detectors. This typically means timing the 
    signals to give vehicles a green wave, though there are other strategies such as shortening other signal phases. 
    Due to the nature of intersections a green wave may be difficult to achieve in both directions with existing infrastructure, 
    and without vehicle detectors influencing the signals a slow zone or other issue could prevent any time savings. The 
    slower signal timing may also slow car traffic even when a bus or train is nowhere near the intersection. As a 
    result, active TSP is generally preferred.
</p>
<p>
    Active TSP is any signal which may prioritize transit using vehicle detection. The signals may be able to shorten, lengthen, 
    or skip a signal phase when a transit vehicle wants to go through the intersection. It may also reorder phases, insert a 
    signal phase exclusively for transit vehicles, or a combination of these five to help transit vehicles get through the 
    intersection faster. More advanced active TSP systems may also be able to decide when to give a transit vehicle priority. 
    All implementations of TSP discussed on this page are some form of active TSP.
</p>
<a name="unconditional"></a>
<h2>Unconditional TSP</h2>
<p>
    Most TSP in Toronto is unconditional. When a transit vehicle is approaching an intersection, the signal will do 
    whatever priority measures it is allowed to do, assuming it is working properly. Over 400 intersections 
    in the City of Toronto already have TSP, but it may not be noticeable as it usually is in the form of a green extension either before 
    or after the pedeestrian countdown. If you've ever seen a Toronto bus get through an intersection after the pedestrian 
    countdown, you might have witnessed TSP in action. See 
    <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2023/ie/bgrd/backgroundfile-239881.pdf">a 2023 map</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Toronto has been using signal priority since
    <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2025/cc/bgrd/backgroundfile-254795.pdf">the mid-1990s</a>. 
    At the time, there were technological barriers to implementing anything other than unconditional TSP. 
    It is much easier to implement unconditional TSP as the only information the signal needs to process 
    is whether a vehicle is present. This leads to the signals letting a vehicle through even when it is ahead of schedule. 
    While this makes trips nominally faster, it also decreases reliability and increases bunching potentially increasing 
    the amount of time journeys take through the increase in wait time. Due to this, I do not believe all TSP in Toronto 
    should be unconditional. Instead, conditions need to be added.
</p>
<a name="conditional"></a>
<h2>Conditional TSP</h2>
<p>
    Conditional TSP is exactly what it sounds like. The vehicle will now have to send the signal additional information which 
    it will then use to determine whether it requires priority. If the vehicle is early, it might deny priority but it will 
    not intentionally give it a red light (unless you program it to do so, perhaps this can be called "anti-priority"). 
    Since any TSP with conditions counts as "Conditional TSP", it is a very broad category. You may even make some actions 
    conditional while others are unconditional, for example extending a green light unconditionally but not allowing phase 
    insertion unless the vehicle is not early.
</p>
 <p>
    We can go further. Schedule adherence is not the only condition you can use. 
    For more frequent routes, headway regularity may be a more important priority than schedule adherence. As a result, 
    you may want to avoid giving full priority to vehicle if another already passed through the intersection two minutes ago. 
    I do not expect Toronto to implement much conditional TSP in the near future apart from Metrolinx projects such as Lines 5 
    and 6 (they do have TSP, though I do not know whether it has been working properly). This is due to the complications with 
    upgrading the TTC's bus fleet to be able to provide signals with more information. I do not expect a political push for this 
    either, as not many people understand the different types of TSP (hopefully this page will change some of that).
</p>
<a name="adaptive"></a>
<h2>Adaptive TSP</h2>
<p>
    Adaptive TSP is the only type I don't quite fully understand. It's defined as giving solutions based on "real-time transit 
    and traffic conditions", perhaps integrated with existing adaptive traffic signal systems. I imagine this as using some 
    kind of optimization algorithm to determine the best course of action to improve transit's speed or reliability.
    It is a much more recent technology which is not widely implemented in many cities. Thus, the exact use cases are 
    not particularly clear at the moment. Most TSP systems around the world are conditional.
</p>
<a name="modifying-the-signal-cycle"></a>
<h2>Modifying the Signal Cycle</h2>
<p>
    All active TSP systems modify signal phses in some way. The most simple forms of this involve modifying existing phases. 
    As discussed above, green extensions are a common occurrence in Toronto. The green extensions come with a time limit, if a 
    vehicle does not move through the intersection fast enough, the light will turn red anyway. This is to ensure opposing 
    traffic can get a green light within a reasonable timeframe. The maximum green extension is typically some number of 
    seconds, though I can not remember the exact number (20 seconds is around the order of magnitude for this). The other 
    kind of phase modification is shortening your red light. This is limited by how far the system can detect a vehicle and how 
    much time it has to give pedestrains to cross the street. If given enough distance, one could finish the pedestrian 
    countdown early enough to avoid the red light. However, the further you might want to detect a vehicle the less reliable 
    your predictions of when the vehicle will come will be.
</p>
<p>
    The next most common modification is adding a transit-only phase. This is the most obvious form of TSP you can get. A 
    common example is letting transit through before a left-turn phase. A small number of intersections along York Region's 
    Viva Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system do this conditionally at intersections with a longer left-turn phase 
    (Keele/Hwy. 7 and Weston/Hwy. 7 come to mind). These can be implemented wherever in the cycle you want, but is most 
    typically done just before the left-turn phase from the street the vehicle is running on (in most centre-running cases, 
    this is the only sensible point for phase insertion).
</p>
<p>
    Apart from those three, there are less common implementations. Reordering phases may allow you to get a green light 
    immediately like with phase insertion, but also would allow drivers to go straight at the same time before a 
    left-turn phase, which would occur after. You could also skip the left-turn phase altogether, though I would not recommend 
    this if left turns are only allowed during the left-turn phase.
</p>
<a name="conflicts"></a>
<h2>Conflicts</h2>
<p>
    As a hypothetical, let us assume that the Jane LRT proposal is built. It will intersect with Line 6 Finch West at-grade at 
    Jane and Finch. Let's say the Jane LRT is at a red light and the Finch LRT is approaching the intersection at a green. 
    Would you stop the Finch LRT and let the Jane LRT through with a phase insertion? Would your answer to that question 
    change if you found out the Jane vehicle was late and the Finch vehicle was early? When two routes which are supposed to be 
    given priority intersect, the question of how to implement TSP becomes much more complex. Originally, the TTC refused to 
    touch these intersections. Nowadays, the priority given is first-come, first-serve. If red light truncation were enabled 
    in this way at Jane and Finch, this may result in the Finch train being hit with a red light.
</p>
<p>
    In this kind of situation, I would attempt to determine which train is worse off (whether due to a delay or headway issue), 
    and prioritize appropriately (perhaps only truncating Line 6's green if that train is early and Jane's is late). 
    Alternatively, I would let the Finch train through then immediately give a red, or 
    simply provide two straight phase insertions for both trains. I personally do not know which option works better, and such 
    a decision may depend on the circumstance. I think you can see now why TSP at major intersections is much more complex. 
    Additionally, while in some cases you would want to prioritize a higher-ridership route, 
    the buses along Finch West and Jane 
    <a href="https://www.ttc.ca/transparency-and-accountability/Operating-Statistics/Operating-Statistics---2024/2024-Boardings">
        had similar ridership in 2024</a>, so that would not be a factor at Jane and Finch.
</p>

<a name="nearside"></a>
<a name="farside"></a>
<h2>Influences on TSP's Effectiveness</h2>
<p>
    TSP is only effective if you can make it work and there are external factors that impact whether it can succeed. 
    Of these, stop location is perhaps the most obvious. When a vehicle stops, you do not know how long it will need 
    at the stop. Even on a rapid transit line, the vehicle may hold due to a headway adjustment or disorderly passenger. 
    Thus, failed priority requests (such as when a green extension runs out of time) are much more common when stops are 
    placed nearside. When stops are placed farside, the stop will occur after the intersection improving the reliability of 
    systems predicting when the vehicle will clear the intersection (including TSP systems).
</p>
<p>
    Frequency is another factor influencing TSP effectiveness. If your line runs too frequently, the signal cycle may be too 
    short to accomodate every TSP request and it may need to activate during every cycle. TSP's reliability begins to 
    decline when frequencies improve beyond every 10 minutes, which would mean a vehicle enters the intersection an average of  
    once every five minutes. If the line needs to carry more people than TSP can handle, perhaps a longer train or an 
    elevated line may be a better solution.
</p>
<p>
    Traffic can also play a role in TSP reliability for mixed-traffic systems, though this is irrelevant to Line 6.
</p>
<a name="speed"></a>
<h2>TSP is Not the Only Problem With Line 6</h2>
<p>
    Line 6 has really low speed limits. I have been told that Line 6 vehicles are only allowed to travel through intersections 
    at 25 km/h, and in street sections the speed limit may also be low. This is not an issue TSP can fix, but one that needs to 
    be fixed by fixing other systems attached to Line 6 and by changing policy at the TTC to favour higher speeds, which would 
    allow vehicles to travel as fast as the road's speed limit. I hope the City can fix this, as it may be an even bigger problem 
    than the signals along Line 6.
</p>
<a name="takeaway"></a>
<h2>The Takeaway</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Transit Signal Priority is not a silver bullet</strong>. It can not fix every problem your transit line has. 
    If red lights are a major issue then better then TSP might help, but if the required level of service is too high it may 
    not help as much or at all. Unconditional TSP sounds fast, but it might make bunching worse. Exactly what priority measures 
    should be unconditional and which should be conditional should be discussed with potential bunching issues in mind. 
    Additionally, if your transit line is slow between intersections it will need more than just better signals to get to the 
    speeds riders expect.
