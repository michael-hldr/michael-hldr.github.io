<h1>Engineering Strategies & Practice</h1>
<p>Many first-year engineering students struggle with APS111/112.
    I'll try my best to explain everything in this page.<br/></p>

<p>
    Engineering Strategies & Practice is a series of two design courses taken in first year in which you are placed in a group of 
    six and tasked with solving a design problem for a client. In APS111, everyone gets the same project but you are unable to 
    directly communicate with your client. In APS112, there will be dozens of projects each worked on by approximately two groups and 
    you will have meetings and contact with your client.<br/><br/>

    As part of the design process, you and your group will be responsible for writing a few documents in support of your project. 
    Engineering writing is required to be direct and blunt. The ideal engineering document is word-efficient: Saying as much as 
    possible with as few words as possible.
</p>

<h2>The "RNG factor"</h2>
<p>
    Most students who talk about this course mention that it is "very RNG". This is partly true. The following may impact your 
    grade in the course:<br/><br/>

    <t/>-<t/><strong>Your teammates</strong>: Even the top engineering school in Canada has bad group members. In APS111 and 112, the group 
    assignments are worth 40% and 60% of your marks, respectively. These marks can be impacted if your teammates act lazy with them. 
    The best way to mitigate this is to set early internal deadlines have good contingency plans for if someone fails to meet them. 
    This may require a significant amount of time for you to fix, so bad teammates will make your life harder (either you lose 
    time or you lose marks)<br/>
    <t/>-<t/><strong>Your tutorial section</strong>: While the teaching team apparently meets to balance the grade averages in 
    individual tutorials, a small sample size may prevent a good balance from being acheived if the tutorial is just really good or 
    really bad (there are only 6 teams per tutorial). Your TA/CI/EM may also care more about certain aspects of the writing than 
    others (though I do not know the degree to which this affects grades in practice).<br/>
    <t/>-<t/><strong>Your client (APS112)</strong>: Not all projects are created equal. In APS112, topics may often not seem like 
    engineering at all: I had to design a lego play area for Prof. Jason Bazylak's kids. Other groups had projects which seemed 
    much more difficult to solve. While they are mainly testing you on your ability to follow the design process (and write) well, 
    research and satisfying the client for some projects will be more challenging, which will impact your final presentation, 
    particularly if your client shows up.<br/>
    <br/>
    You should avoid blaming your low grades entirely on uncontrollable factors. Doing so will inhibit your ability 
    to improve as you may not feel motivated to put in any additional effort.
</p>

<h1>APS112 Assignments</h1>
<p>
    Congratulations, you’ve gotten APS111 out of the way!
    The start of APS112 will be deja vu for you, as you will have another Team Charter (7%)
    and Project Requirements (10%) doc to do with a new team
    (there may be some added requirements for the TC, I don’t remember completely).
    However, there are a few new things I would like to bring up (and not the lack of mandatory Perusall readings).
</p>
<h2>The Client</h2>
<p>
    The biggest added “RNG factor” in this course is your client. 
    They may suck at writing a client statement and give you unnecessary info. 
    You may find your friend got a project you wish you would have done instead<sup>1</sup>. 
    The client statement may confuse you at first.<br/><br/>
    You will need to set up three client meetings during the semester. 
    All client communication must be approved by the Engineering Manager (EM)<sup>2</sup> 
    before being sent, including your intended questions during meetings. 
    In-person meetings are preferred unless the client is located outside Greater Toronto 
    or the client is unable to do one. One of my friends had to go to Markham for client meetings. 
    Your engineering notebook will be very important here as you generally can not 
    record meetings so your notes will be the only record of what happened. <br/><br/>
    The first meeting will be yours to ask questions that will help you with writing your 
    Project Requirements (particularly if the client statement was vague). 
    The second will be a review of the Project Requirements. The client may ask you to adjust 
    the FOCs as they see fit. For example, my client requested we lower our budget from
     $5,000 to $1,500 for the project<sup>3</sup>. The third will be a review of the CDS, 
     similar to that of the Project Requirements.<br/><br/>
    Your client may also show up to the final presentation and ask questions. 
    The CI and EM present may factor that into your final presentation grade. 
    I will discuss the final presentation further below.
</p>
<h2>Status Reports</h2>
<p>
Each of your six team members will need to write a status report and
send it to your EM at some point during the semester.
These are not graded, but rather are one of the factors your EM will look at when determining
your Performance Review grade. There is a template for it and there are two parts.
Part 1 must be submitted on MS Teams before your tutorial (or earlier,
please ask your EM for clarification if you’re not sure) and contains your team’s agenda
for that tutorial, current tasks, issues the team encountered since the last status report
 and how it dealt with them, and decisions the team made since the last status report.
 You must also submit relevant parts of your team’s Gantt Chart for Part A.
 Following your tutorial, the person responsible for that week’s status report must
 submit a table of upcoming tasks within 24 hours.
</p>
<h2>The Preliminary Literature Review (PLR)</h2>
<p>
The Preliminary Literature Review is an individual assignment worth 5% of your final mark. 
It’s a simple worksheet where you do the following:<br/>
    -Introduce and state your research question<br/>
    -Link to and cite your source using proper IEEE formatting<br/>
    -Perform the CRAAP test on your source<br/>
    -Explain the relationship between your source and the project.<br/>
</p>
<h2>Team Role Observation & Analysis (TROA)</h2>
<p>
    This 10% individual assignment is similar to your Teamwork Analysis, but with some key differences. 
    The situation you choose must show how you fit your role in the team in that situation. 
    Like in the Teamwork Analysis, you will analyze whether the team charter helped and suggest 
    changes to it in your conclusion. However, if you do not think you fit this role you may 
    instead suggest a different role which would be better suited for you.<br/><br/>
    This was comfortably my worst assignment in APS112.
</p>
<h2>The Midterm</h2>
<p>
    This midterm will be late in the semester and it will be the only exam in the course<sup>4</sup>. 
    In 2024, it was held the day after the CDS deadline. In 2025, it was held approximately two weeks earlier. Two-thirds of the 
    multiple-choice questions will be similar in style to the APS111 exam. 
    There were one or two questions about estimation, and the questions outside the first two-thirds involved Gantt Charts 
    (i.e. scheduling). The midterm is worth 15% of your final grade and the median grade for the 
    2024 midterm was 60%.
</p>
<h2>Design Review Gateway (DRG)</h2>
<p>
    <strong>
        This assignment has been removed from the course as of Winter 2025 and its weight redistributed among 
        other assignments.
    </strong><br/><br/>

    In mid-March (around 2 weeks before the CDS is due), your team will present its progress 
    on the project, including an overview of the project, changes made during your 
    second client meeting, any challenges your team has faced, and the current status of the project. 
    The point of this presentation is to convince your EM and CI that your project is going well. 
    If you are a design engineer, a failing or below grade would indicate your boss may 
    pull the plug on your project. For this reason, it is crucial to not procrastinate too much 
    on your CDS. You will have an 8-minute time limit (you may be cut off at that time) and 
    the CDS and EM will ask you questions after. Hostile questions are possible.<br/><br/>
    This presentation is worth 5% of your final mark, the weighting of which will be moved 
    to your final presentation if you do better on it. If you would like to learn more 
    about presentation skills, I can’t remember them right now but I have some material to help. 
    Please contact me if you’d like it.
</p>
<h2>The CDS</h2>
<p>
    In 112, the CDS will be similar to that in 111 but will also contain your measures of success. 
    These will be more detailed tests of your solution and may involve prototyping or running 
    a simulation. That doesn’t mean you’ll need it to be that advanced, but at least 
    make some kind of model. In the CDS, you will talk about the measures of success 
    you plan on doing. After you are done your CDS, you will perform these tests 
    in preparation for your final presentation.<br/><br/>
    Like in APS111, the CDS is worth 20% of your final mark.
</p>
<h2>The Final Presentation</h2>
<p>
    Your team’s 20% final presentation is the “final exam” of ESP II, held any time between 9 and 6 
    on the first day of exams. The table of rooms and times will be posted in advance. 
    Like the DRG, you will have a time limit (this one is 12 minutes). 
    You will be cut off at the limit whether or not you were able to finish. 
    The point of this presentation is to convince your client to implement your design solution 
    or one of your alternatives.<br/><br/>
    After your presentation, you can be questioned by the CI, EM, the client (if they come), 
    or anyone else in the room. The CI and EM are not the same CI and EM you had 
    throughout the semester, and your client may be the EM if they are part of the teaching team.
     You are allowed to visit other people’s presentations as long as 
     you aren’t doing your own at that time. In my section, the CI gave two of the three groups 
     who presented hostile questions (my group was spared).<br/><br/>
    The final presentation is worth 20% of your final mark. When we did the DRG, the DRG weight was 
    redistributed to the final presentation when the group's final presentation mark is better than their DRG grade.
</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
    
<p>
    1. This happened to me last year.<br/>
    2. The Engineering Manager is a new member of the teaching team for APS112, found in your tutorials. They act as your boss.<br/>
    3. It was unclear to our team what the exact number was and we forgot to ask during the first meeting. 
   This is not the only reason this can happen (the client may have second thoughts about what they wrote on their client statement, for example)<br/>
    4. Unless you count the final presentation
