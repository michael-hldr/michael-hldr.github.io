<h1>Uni Advice</h1>
<p>
    Welcome to the University of Toronto! If you are in engineering, you are probably worried about a few things: your grades, your 
    job prospects, what design teams you should join, etc.. I hope this page and some sub-pages I plan on adding help 
    you with some of those. This page is currently a work in progress. I have amassed a good deal of course advice for first-years, but I have some 
    advice on other topics I will add when I have time to.<br/><br/>
</p>
<h2>General advice</h2>
<p>
    If you are doing well in your courses, do not focus too much on your 
    grades. Career advancement requires you to be doing okay, but you should not forget that activities outside the classroom 
    such as design teams and personal projects are just as important. I got my first interview from a personal project and going 
    to career fairs, not because of my grades.<br/><br/>

    It is generally good to find a design team you enjoy, but design teams are not the only extracurricular you can partake in. 
    Sometimes, your strongest interests are not fulfilled by a design team and you might want to do a 
    <a href="/projects">personal project</a> instead. As mentioned above, people have seemed more impressed by my personal projects 
    than my work in design teams. That being said, you generally get less help with personal projects: One can not use the Myhal 
    Fabrication Facility for them and you will not have a large group of experienced peers. However, you will likely find people 
    with similar interests who can help you.<br/><br/>

    Would you like to transfer between Core 8 programs after first year? It is possible, but depending on what you want to transfer into 
    you will need to make the Dean's Honours List (average grade at least 79.5%) in both semesters. This is generally true if you 
    are transferring into ECE, Mechanical, or Industrial Engineering. Otherwise, you can probably do so as long as you have a 65% 
    average both semesters and have a clean academic record (this can change between years depending on demand). If you are in a 
    high-demand program and want to transfer to another high-demand program (Generally Mech, Industrial, ECE), 
    you may be able to do so without getting Dean's List both semesters if your transfer frees up a spot for someone else 
    to transfer to your discipline. This happened to a 2T7 in Industrial Engineering who transferred to ECE. This likely does 
    not occur for students in Chemical, Civil, Mineral, or MSE as more people transfer out of these programs than into them in 
    any particular year.<br/><br/>

    If you would like to skip classes, please do so with care. During my first semester of second year, I had a problem with 
    skipping and being less attentive in class. This combined with poor study habits caused my grades to drop 5% that semester. 
    If you are going to skip a lecture, please care to review the material on or near the day of the lecture if possible (and 
    have a good reason to do so, I found it easier to not skip when I forced myself to have a reason to during second semester). 
    If you are going to skip a tutorial, first ensure you do not actually need to attend it (not all tutorials are created equal). 
    <br/><br/>

    Do not always rely on a curve, one second-year professor said to us and the 2T6s he would curve the final average to a B, 
    but did not do so for either year (the final averages were C+ for the 2T6s and a B- for us). People may also just do really well 
    during your year, as has happened in some 2nd year Civil Engineering courses I took.
</p>
<h2>Courses</h2>
<p>
    This section is accurate as 
    of the 2024-25 academic year and may be out of date if a course is restructured or a course coordinator is 
    changed. Please <a href="/contact">contact me</a> if you notice any errors.<br/><br/>

    Special thanks to Matthew Kong (ECE 2T8), who has supplied some of his advice for this section. You might find 
    <a href="https://mattkongnotes.vercel.app/">his notes</a> useful. If I mention 
    him without mentioning myself, it is probably because it involves something I have not tried (ex. Going 
    to Sean Uppal's lectures).
</p>
<h3>APS110</h3>
<p>
    The textbook is quite useful, but the practice problems there are not great for practice. Those problems 
    are (generally) free marks and you get most of your TopHat marks just by attempting them. When studying, 
    please look at past exams when possible as well as your assignments and quizzes. The textbook does not 
    have some of the longer calculation problems you might find on exams. For courses with a lot of knowledge 
    like this one, studying early is a good idea to ensure you can understand everything before an exam.
</p>
<h3>APS111/112</h3>
<p>
    Engineering Strategies & Practice (ESP) is a learning curve. I started my 1F term performing 
    very poorly in APS111, especially compared to my other courses. However, one can make a comeback in ESP as 
    I did in APS111.<br/><br/>
    
    In early October, you will be placed in a group of approximately six people with which you will work on a 
    design project. You might not like the project, and that's okay. Most people will likely agree with you. It 
    is the design process you learn that matters most. You may be put in a bad group or have a TA or 
    CI whose marking scheme you do not understand (I am told they try to balance the marks between tutorial sections).
    Having any of those will not prevent you from passing the course, but it may prevent you from achieving 
    the mark you want. 
    
    There are ways to partly remedy bad groups: Internal deadlines of assignment drafts 
    are one I would recommend (Matthew Kong and I both recommend setting this date at least two days prior 
    to the deadline). 
    However, you will need to actively check your group's work after the internal deadline and/or ask your 
    EM/CI/TA for feedback (if they allow it) if you want to 
    take this route. That will ensure you catch the most painful mistakes and see who might be making them.
    Matthew Kong recommends closely following the assignment reference handbook, particularly for assignments 
    his CI marked. This is a good idea, though the amount it matters likely varies by who your TA/CI/EM is.<br/><br/>

    There are a few free marks in APS111 and APS112. PD points involve going to events such as Myfab Safety Training, 
    which will enhance your skills in some way. Each PD point is worth 0.1% of your final grade and is reflected 
    in your performance review grade. The performance review itself is not difficult to do well in as long as you 
    are focused during tutorials.<br/><br/>
<!--  -->
    APS112 will have a similar design project, except you'll only be sharing each design project with two or 
    three other groups. Getting a bad project may demotivate you (especially if you lack interest or it makes 
    research more difficult), but otherwise I think the impact of one is less bad than the 2T8s I know think it 
    is.<br/><br/>

    See the <a href="./ESP">ESP page</a> for more information about APS112.
</p>
<h3>Calculus (MAT186 and MAT187)</h3>
<p>
    If you are looking for <a href="./calc/asymptote.html">
        my page on vertical asymptotes, click here
    </a>. If you are looking for <a href="./calc/midterm-2.html">
        my page on Winter 2025 Midterm 2, click here
    </a><br/><br/>

    I strongly recommend you take 
    <a href="https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/first-year-office-2/first-year-updates-deadlines/early-start-courses/">
        APS162
    </a> in the summer before first year and take APS163 during the fall if you can. As of the 2024-25 
    academic year, they are run better (according to the 2T8s I have talked to) and in the event you are doing poorly (before the 
    drop deadline), you can drop the course and take it the following semester. Completing APS162 also gives 
    you the opportunity to either have a smaller work load for a semester in first year or to take an additional 
    elective course, which can be used to help satisfy your CS/HSS requirements. Registration for APS162 opens 
    in early June and the course fills up quickly.<br/><br/>

    If you believe in September that MAT187 will be more well-run than APS163 (or have similar feelings regarding 
    APS162), keep in mind that course coordinators can be switched. In October 2024, Prof. Camelia Karimianpour 
    was replaced as coordinator by Prof. Jason Siefken, who is unpopular among the 2T8s I have heard from. Thus, 
    do not assume MAT187 will be better. Only drop APS163 if you are doing poorly in that course.<br/><br/>

    If you are taking MAT186, Matthew Kong recommends attending Sean Uppal's lectures and using his notes and 
    practice problems to study as many exam questions come from similar concepts and edge cases.<br/><br/>

    If you are taking MAT187, spend a good amount of time reviewing the textbook and other materials if 
    possible to ensure you understand the concepts. At least one student told me the textbook was good for exam practice for 
    Prof. Siefken's exams.
    I will update this page in the event the 
    coordinator changes again.
</p>
<h3>CIV100, CIV102, and other structural courses</h3>
<p>
    <strong>These courses require a lot of practice.</strong> The practice problems are very good at getting 
    you to understand the concepts so you may screw yourself over for your exams if you cheat on the assignments. These 
    assignments take time and you have a week to do them, so set aside some time every week if you are worried 
    you will not get time to finish them.<br/><br/>

    In most structural courses, it is best to spend most of your time doing past midterms and final exams. In CIV100, 
    Prof. Michael Seica often re-uses old test questions and the format does not change (Matthew & I can both attest to this). 
    I have not determined whether this is the best idea in CIV102 as I have not taken it myself.<br/><br/>
    
    Paying attention in class is also sometimes important, and I learned 
    that the hard way in CME210. However, if you are missing important knowledge or just want to learn ahead, there 
    are plenty of <a href="./civ/index.html#resources">resources</a> available online. Such resources are 
    particularly helpful in CIV100, as students often have bad experiences with their 
    profs and learn better with the linked resources, which cover most or all of the material. 
    When using these resources, ensure they really cover all the material you need.
    <br/><br/>
</p>
<h3>Linear Algebra (MAT188)</h3>
<p>
    <strong>
        I will be paying close attention to the course in 2025F, as I have heard rumours of a course coordinator 
        change.
    </strong><br><br/>
    This course has a lot of free marks because of the use of standards-based grading and the dropping of your 
    six lowest pre-class essentials marks. To get them, ensure you are caught up with the course material. 
    These grades are worth 29% of your final mark, almost as much as the final exam (35%). I am aware Linear 
    Algebra is difficult for some, but I believe the point of these free marks is to ensure you are 
    spending enough time on the course to understand the material, particularly since it is very difficult to 
    catch up on the material once you fall behind (I know many 2T8s who fell victim to this).<br/><br/>

    If you want to study ahead for any course in the summer (taking APS162 doesn't count), study ahead for 188. 
    This and constantly getting free marks allowed me to avoid falling behind in the course (it was my second 
    best grade that semester).
</p>
<h3>APS105/106</h3>
<p>
    The people familiar with programming will find the midterm(s) easy and you will probably not need to spend 
    much time on the course.<br/><br/>
    
    If you are taking APS105, the final exam will be significantly harder than 
    the midterm. It will have more difficult questions and there will be much more of them relative to the time given. 
    Matthew Kong noted that many students are much worse with the later topics than earlier topics, so you should study them more 
    and give yourself enough practice especially if you are unfamiliar with them.
</p>
<h3>CHE112</h3>
<p>
    Chemistry generally requires a lot of effort and you will spend a lot of your time in this class. I was able 
    to save some time thanks to prior knowledge taking AP Chemistry the previous year. The term tests in the 
    course are quite difficult, though in 2024-25 (when they began having two midterms instead of one) students 
    performed significantly better in midterm 1. You can choose your lab groups, but you might need to choose 
    within your tutorial.
</p>
<h3>CIV185</h3>
<p>
    CIV185 has open-book tests. However, the tests were difficult as most did not understand the content that well. 
    The slideshows are usually very long and if you are not great at memorization you will struggle with them, 
    especially for the rocks portion of the course.
</p>
<h2>First-year Courses not taken in Civil Engineering</h2>
<p>
    All notes in this section are from Matthew Kong's experience during the 2024-25 school year unless stated otherwise.
</p>
<h3>MIE100</h3>
<p>
    People generally find that the content for this course gets much harder after the midterm, 
    and so the averages on the final exam tend to be significantly below other assessments. 
    This is partially because the content after the midterm (rigid bodies, vibrations) becomes more involved, 
    but also because (anecdotally) students tend to stop studying the content as much after completing the midterm (I agree with 
    Matthew Kong's assessment here).

    Thus, Kong highly recommends trying to keep up with the content later in the semester.
    You should study this course like you would study CIV100: A lot of practice. Like CIV100, there are no conceptual questions 
    on the quiz, midterm, or final. The teaching team posts plenty of past exams on Quercus you can use for practice. Kong notes 
    the assignment questions are significantly harder than the quiz/exam questions, so being able to solve them yourself is not 
    as necessary as in CIV100. However, you should understand what the question is about. The assignments have unlimited attempts 
    so you do not have to be certain when giving an answer.
    
    The exams are type C. From my experience with type C exams, it is best to write down formulae and concepts you may forget 
    (you may want to ensure you know what content you might forget first). Make sure all your info is correct.
</p>
<h3>ECE110</h3>
<p>
    Like in CIV100, studying practice problems is very useful for this course. However, the exams here also feature conceptual 
    questions which reviewing the lecture slides may be best for (especially for the physics portion of the course). The 
    textbook and assignment problems are similar in difficulty to the exam questions, so try to do your assignment questions 
    properly and use them and the textbook for practice. Most physics assignment questions have randomized numbers, 
    though solutions to very similar problems (perhaps only with different numbers) can be found online. The circuit questions 
    generally do not change. Only use those solutions if you are stuck or 
    would like to verify your answer. Avoid going too deep into the textbook, as it features proofs unnecessary for this course.
</p>
<h2>Second-year Civil Engineering</h2>
<p>

    This section is a work in progress and may be split from this page when it is done.
</p>
<h3>CIV201 / CIV282</h3>
<p>
    Your notebook for CIV201 is very important, being worth 70% of your final grade in the course. Do not procrastinate 
    on completing it like I did, as it caused me to do poorly in the course despite my final report mark being better than anything 
    else I did in CIV282.<br/><br/>

    CIV282 is a communication course which often combines its assignments with other courses. These combined assignments are your 
    CIV201 final report and the CIV220 Urban Metabolism Assignment. During drafting for both assignments, you will submit a 
    draft version. Try finishing most of it by this date to get valuable feedback. Each draft is worth 5% of your CIV282 grade. 
    After your Urban Metabolism Assignment, you will be put in a group for a final presentation about some urban metabolism-related 
    problems either one specific city or the entire world is facing. The teaching team will pair people who did the same city for the 
    Urban Metabolism Assignment if at least four in your tutorial did so, so getting a group of 4 to do the same city will increase 
    your chance of getting a group you want for this presentation.
</p>
<h3>CIV220</h3>
<p>
    This course is not hard, apart from the Urban Metabolism Assignment. However, with only four things making up your mark you 
    should be careful: Do not procrastinate on studying for your final exam like I did. The midterm/final format is predictable and 
    knowledge-based so the best way to study is to review your knowledge and look at past tests.
</p>
<h3>CIV235</h3>
<p>
    This course requires a lot of practice, particularly for the freehand section. Prof. Rad has specific standards for you to follow 
    for the CAD sections and specific techniques for the freehand section. Sticking to them requires practice and Prof. Rad is not 
    always nice when grading.
</p>
<h3>CME261</h3>
<p>
    This course suffered from a lack of practice problems when I took it. During this time, the best way to practice was to review 
    the tutorial problems, though the exam problems were often harder than them. Unlike some other math courses, answers here are 
    often not clean so avoid assuming you are wrong when you get a weird answer on a test (you should still try checking your work 
    if you have extra time, though).
</p>
<h3>CME270</h3>
<p>
    The lectures for this course are well-structured, and Prof. Hofmann provides a lot of examples. Practice problems are the best 
    way to study here, but you should also try avoiding silly mistakes as the graders are often very tough on mistakes. You can 
    choose your groups for your labs and assignments (these are the same groups). The labs and assignments are not marked as tough 
    as the tests are.
</p>
<h3>CIV280</h3>
<p>
    This course is also well-structured. This course has a lot of memorization, but exam content can vary wildly from year to year. 
    I did very well on the final exam because it contained a heavy amount of scheduling content. The term projects will help you 
    here, and I would advise avoiding procrastinating on them. One upper-year did one of his term projects early to avoid needing 
    to do it near two midterms. These term projects make up a majority (55%) of your final grade and for the two group projects, 
    you are able to choose your groups.
</p>
<h3>CIV209</h3>
<p>
    Past exams (particularly the 2023 exam) have so much content that they are good study material on their own, especially given 
    the slides are very dense and it is difficult for one to get through all of it. Most questions are conceptual, so ensure you 
    know and understand the concepts. Your continued understanding of the content will help you during the lecture quizzes, but 
    those quizzes are rather difficult.
</p>
<h3>CIV250</h3>
<p>
    Like CIV209, this course have a lot of content. However, the quizzes are not difficult and are not graded. They are good prep 
    for the conceptual questions, which are very important to understand completely as Prof. Basheer marks them very strictly. 
    The calculation questions are not difficult, but with the professor marking hard you should ensure you understand all the 
    content.
</p>
<h3>CME259</h3>
<p>
    This is a humanities course with a lot of writing and you will be required to note relationships between concepts. 
    Participating in seminar is very important (seminars are worth 30% of your mark, and are not marked that easy) and you should 
    ensure you understand all the concepts. If you are afraid you will be unable to, your aid sheet will be very useful for the 
    midterm and final. You will be able to bring two aid sheets to the final exam.
</p>
<h3>CME262</h3>
<p>
    This course has very few conceptual questions. Prof. Seungjae Lee prefers most numerical methods to be tested in homework 
    assignments using python, so your exam questions will not be tedious. The questions are not hard as long as you understand 
    the conepts, though due to their nature I would still recommend praticing for exams.
</p>
<h3>CME263</h3>
<p>
    This course assumes you have not taken MDM4U (Data Management) in high school. If you took it or AP Statistics, some parts 
    of this course may be easy. On your midterms, you will get six questions, with your worst question dropped from your grade. 
    During the first 2025 midterm, many students did the questions in order, causing them to spend a lot of time on 
    one question then being unable to finish the test (the average for this test was 61%). To avoid this, save any tedious test 
    questions for last. If you are afraid you will do poorly on the midterms, the assignments should be rather easy for you. 
    As well, you should practice using assignment (and maybe tutorial) problems, though the tutorial problems are easier than 
    test problems.
