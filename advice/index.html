<h2>Courses</h2>
<p>
    I am compiling some of my thoughts on various courses I have taken at UofT Engineering. They are accurate as 
    of the 2024-25 academic year and may be out of date if a course is restructured or a course coordinator is 
    changed. Please <a href="/contact">contact me</a> if you notice any errors.<br/><br/>

    Special tanks to Matthew Kong (ECE 2T8), who has supplied some of his advice for this page. You might find 
    <a href="https://mattkongnotes.vercel.app/">his notes</a> useful. If I mention 
    him without mentioning myself, it is probably because it involves something I have not tried (ex. Going 
    to Sean Uppal's lectures).
</p>
<h3>APS110</h3>
<p>
    The textbook is quite useful, but the practice problems there are not great for practice. Those problems 
    are (generally) free marks and you get most of your TopHat marks just by attempting them. When studying, 
    please look at past exams when possible as well as your assignments and quizzes. The textbook does not 
    have some of the longer calculation problems you might find on exams. For courses with a lot of knowledge 
    like this one, studying early is a good idea to ensure you can understand everything before an exam.
</p>
<h3>APS111/112</h3>
<p>
    Engineering Strategies & Practice (ESP) is a learning curve. I started my 1F term performing 
    very poorly in APS111, especially compared to my other courses. However, one can make a comeback in ESP as 
    I did in APS111.<br/><br/>
    
    In early October, you will be placed in a group of approximately six people with which you will work on a 
    design project. You might not like the project, and that's okay. Most people will likely agree with you. It 
    is the design process you learn that matters most. You may be put in a bad group or have a TA or 
    CI whose marking scheme you do not understand (I am told they try to balance the marks between tutorial sections).
    Having any of those will not prevent you from passing the course, but it may prevent you from achieving 
    the mark you want. 
    
    There are ways to partly remedy bad groups: Internal deadlines of assignment drafts 
    are one I would recommend (Matthew Kong and I both recommend setting this date at least two days prior 
    to the deadline). 
    However, you will need to actively check your group's work after the internal deadline and/or ask your 
    EM/CI/TA for feedback (if they allow it) if you want to 
    take this route. That will ensure you catch the most painful mistakes and see who might be making them.
    Matthew Kong recommends closely following the assignment reference handbook, particularly for assignments 
    his CI marked. This is a good idea, though the amount it matters likely varies by who your TA/CI/EM is.<br/><br/>

    There are a few free marks in APS111 and APS112. PD points involve going to events such as Myfab Safety Training, 
    which will enhance your skills in some way. Each PD point is worth 0.1% of your final grade and is reflected 
    in your performance review grade. The performance review itself is not difficult to do well in as long as you 
    are focused during tutorials.<br/><br/>
<!--  -->
    APS112 will have a similar design project, except you'll only be sharing each design project with two or 
    three other groups. Getting a bad project may demotivate you (especially if you lack interest or it makes 
    research more difficult), but otherwise I think the impact of one is less bad than the 2T8s I know think it 
    is.<br/><br/>

    See the <a href="/courses/ESP">ESP page</a> for more information about APS112.
</p>
<h3>Calculus (MAT186 and MAT187)</h3>
<p>
    If you are looking for <a href="/courses/calc/asymptote.html">
        my page on vertical asymptotes, click here
    </a>. If you are looking for <a href="/courses/calc/midterm-2.html">
        my page on Winter 2025 Midterm 2, click here
    </a><br/><br/>

    I strongly recommend you take 
    <a href="https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/first-year-office-2/first-year-updates-deadlines/early-start-courses/">
        APS162
    </a> in the summer before first year and take APS163 during the fall if you can. As of the 2024-25 
    academic year, they are run better (according to the 2T8s I have talked to) and in the event you are doing poorly (before the 
    drop deadline), you can drop the course and take it the following semester. Completing APS162 also gives 
    you the opportunity to either have a smaller work load for a semester in first year or to take an additional 
    elective course, which can be used to help satisfy your CS/HSS requirements. Registration for APS162 opens 
    in early June and the course fills up quickly.<br/><br/>

    If you believe in September that MAT187 will be more well-run than APS163 (or have similar feelings regarding 
    APS162), keep in mind that course coordinators can be switched. In October 2024, Prof. Camelia Karimianpour 
    was replaced as coordinator by Prof. Jason Siefken, who is unpopular among the 2T8s I have heard from. Thus, 
    do not assume MAT187 will be better. Only drop APS163 if you are doing poorly in that course.<br/><br/>

    If you are taking MAT186, Matthew Kong recommends attending Sean Uppal's lectures and using his notes and 
    practice problems to study as many exam questions come from similar concepts and edge cases.<br/><br/>

    If you are taking MAT187, spend a good amount of time reviewing the textbook and other materials if 
    possible to ensure you understand the concepts. I will update this page in the event the 
    coordinator changes again.
</p>
<h3>CIV100, CIV102, and other structural courses</h3>
<p>
    These courses require a decent amount of practice. The practice problems are very good at getting 
    you to understand the concepts so you may screw yourself over for your exams if you cheat on the assignments. These 
    assignments take time and you have a week to do them, so set aside some time every week if you are worried 
    you will not get time to finish them.<br/><br/>

    In CIV100, it is best to spend most of your time doing past midterms and final exams. Prof. Michael Seica often 
    re-uses old test questions and the format does not change (Matthew & I can both attest to this). I have 
    not determined whether this is the best idea in CIV102 or CIV214, but for CME210 it is best to practice 
    past exams.<br/><br/>
    
    Paying attention in class is also sometimes important, and I learned 
    that the hard way in CME210. However, if you are missing important knowledge or just want to learn ahead, there 
    are plenty of <a href="./civ/index.html#resources">resources</a> available online. Such resources are 
    particularly helpful in CIV100, as students often have bad experiences with their 
    profs and learn better with the linked resources, which cover most or all of the material. 
    When using these resources, ensure they really cover all the material you need.
    <br/><br/>
</p>
<h3>Linear Algebra (MAT188)</h3>
<p>
    <strong>
        I will be paying close attention to the course in 2025F, as I have heard rumours of a course coordinator 
        change.
    </strong><br><br/>
    This course has a lot of free marks because of the use of standards-based grading and the dropping of your 
    six lowest pre-class essentials marks. To get them, ensure you are caught up with the course material. 
    These grades are worth 29% of your final mark, almost as much as the final exam (35%). I am aware Linear 
    Algebra is difficult for some, but I believe the point of these free marks is to ensure you are 
    spending enough time on the course to understand the material, particularly since it is very difficult to 
    catch up on the material once you fall behind (I know many 2T8s who fell victim to this).<br/><br/>

    If you want to study ahead for any course in the summer (taking APS162 doesn't count), study ahead for 188. 
    This and constantly getting free marks allowed me to avoid falling behind in the course (it was my second 
    best grade that semester).
</p>
<h3>APS105/106</h3>
<p>
    The people familiar with programming will find the midterm(s) easy and you will probably not need to spend 
    much time on the course. If you are taking APS105, the final exam will be significantly more harshly graded 
    than an easy midterm as the teaching team would like the course average to be a B-.
</p>
<h3>CHE112</h3>
<p>
    Chemistry generally requires a lot of effort and you will spend a lot of your time in this class. I was able 
    to save some time thanks to prior knowledge taking AP Chemistry the previous year. The term tests in the 
    course are quite difficult, though in 2024-25 (when they began having two midterms instead of one) students 
    performed significantly better in midterm 1. You can choose your lab groups, but you might need to choose 
    within your tutorial.
</p>
<h3>CIV185</h3>
<p>
    CIV185 has open-book tests. However, the tests were difficult as most did not understand the content that well. 
    The slideshows are usually very long and if you are not great at memorization you will struggle with them, 
    especially for the rocks portion of the course.
</p>
<h2>Second-year Civil Engineering</h2>
<p>
    During my first semester, I had very bad study habits. This included regularly skipping class and procrastinating much more 
    on assignments and studying than during any other semester. The result was a 5% drop in my grades. If you are going to skip 
    a lecture, please care to review the material on or near the day of the lecture if possible. If you are going to skip a tutorial, 
    ensure you do not actually need to attend it first (not all tutorials are created equal). Do not rely on a curve either, one 
    professor in this section said to us and the 2T6s he would curve the final average to a B, but did not do so for 
    either year (the final averages were C+ and B-, respectively).<br/><br/>

    This section is a work in progress and may be split from this page when it is done.
</p>
<h3>CIV201 / CIV282</h3>
<p>
    Your notebook for CIV201 is very important, being worth 70% of your final grade in the course. Do not procrastinate 
    on completing it like I did, as it caused me to do poorly in the course despite my final report mark being better than anything 
    else I did in CIV282.<br/><br/>

    CIV282 is a communication course which often combines its assignments with other courses. These combined assignments are your 
    CIV201 final report and the CIV220 Urban Metabolism Assignment. During drafting for both assignments, you will submit a 
    draft version. Try finishing most of it by this date to get valuable feedback. Each draft is worth 5% of your CIV282 grade. 
    After your Urban Metabolism Assignment, you will be put in a group for a final presentation about some urban metabolism-related 
    problems either one specific city or the entire world is facing. The teaching team will pair people who did the same city for the 
    Urban Metabolism Assignment if at least four in your tutorial did so, so getting a group of 4 to do the same city will increase 
    your chance of getting a group you want for this presentation.
</p>
<h3>CIV220</h3>
<p>
    This course is not hard, apart from the Urban Metabolism Assignment. However, with only four things making up your mark you 
    should be careful: Do not procrastinate on studying for your final exam like I did. The midterm/final format is predictable and 
    knowledge-based so the best way to study is to review your knowledge and look at past tests.
</p>
<h3>CIV235</h3>
<p>
    This course requires a lot of practice, particularly for the freehand section. Prof. Rad has specific standards for you to follow 
    for the CAD sections and specific techniques for the freehand section. Sticking to them requires practice and Prof. Rad is not 
    always nice when grading.
</p>
<h3>CME261</h3>
<p>
    This course suffered from a lack of practice problems when I took it. During this time, the best way to practice was to review 
    the tutorial problems, though the exam problems were often harder than them. Unlike some other math courses, answers here are 
    often not clean so avoid assuming you are wrong when you get a weird answer on a test (you should still try checking your work 
    if you have extra time, though).
</p>
<h3>CME270</h3>
<p>
    The lectures for this course are well-structured, and Prof. Hofmann provides a lot of examples. Practice problems are the best 
    way to study here, but you should also try avoiding silly mistakes as the graders are often very tough on mistakes. You can 
    choose your groups for your labs and assignments (these are the same groups). The labs and assignments are not marked as tough 
    as the tests are.
</p>
<h3>CIV280</h3>
<p>
    This course is also well-structured. This course has a lot of knowledge, but exam content can vary wildly from year to year. 
    I did very well on the final exam because it contained a heavy amount of scheduling content. The term projects will help you 
    here, and I would advise avoiding procrastinating on them. One upper-year did one of his term projects early to avoid needing 
    to do it near two midterms. These term projects make up a majority (55%) of your final grade and for the two group projects, 
    you are able to choose your groups.
