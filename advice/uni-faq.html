<h1>Frequently Asked Questions about University</h1>
<p>
    Questions will be added to this page as I see fit.
</p>

<h2>Exams</h2>

<a name="exam-types"></a>
<h3>What are the types of exams?</h3>
<p>
    These are noted on <a href="https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/exams/exam-types-permitted-calculators/">
        the faculty website
    </a>. I 
    have simplified it below:
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">
    <strong>Type A or B</strong>: You can not bring any of your own material, everything you need is provided.<br/>

    <strong>Type C</strong>: You can print a double-sided aid sheet using 
    <a href="https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Examination-Aid-Sheet-0215.pdf">
        this template
    </a>. The content on this sheet can be whatever you want it to be. 
    <strong>C1</strong> exams require you to physically write on the page, <strong>C2</strong> lets you additionally 
    write on a tablet, and <strong>C3</strong> allows you to type, paste images, anything you'd like as long as it fits.<br/>

    <strong>Type D</strong>: The examiner will let you know beforehand what you're allowed to bring. For example, you may be 
    allowed to bring a steel standards manual for your Steel and Timber Exam.<br/>

    <strong>Type X</strong>: Open book. You can bring any physical material you want, assuming it is not your phone or any 
    other device that can connect with the outside world during your exam.<br/>

    <strong>Type O</strong>: Not covered above. The examiner will tell you beforehand what exactly this means.
</p>
<a name="calculators"></a>
<h3>What calculators can I bring to my exams?</h3>
<p>
    This depends on your examiner, but usually it is <strong>Type 3</strong>, which are non-programmable calculators approved 
    by the Faculty. These are Casio FX991 models and Sharp EL-W516 and EL-520 models. In 2nd year and up, TI-30X models 
    are allowed as well. Some may also allow any non-programmable calculator, but I would not advise spending extra on a new 
    calculator for that. Exams which allow programmable calculators are rare, while exams not allowing any calculator will 
    typically occur for first-year MAT courses and other courses where very little calculation is needed (ex. APS111/112).
</p>

<a name="exam-weight"></a>
<h3>How much will exams be worth?</h3>
<p>
    Within your first two years, final exams will typically be weighted between 35 and 50%. Midterm weight will vary by course 
    and some will have two midterms. Individual midterm exams have been weighted as low as 10% (MAT188, which has two) and 
    as high as 35% (CIV100, which has one). You may have other tests like in-tutorial or in-lecture quizzes. The professor 
    will usually tell you this in the syllabus.
</p>
<p>
    The exception to the rule of weightings is APS111, which has a 25% final exam. 
    Project-based courses will emphasize assignments more so if they have a final exam (APS112 does not), it will be 
    weighted significantly less than those in other courses.
</p>

<a name="are-exams-cumulative"></a>
<h3>Do exams cover content before the midterm?</h3>
<p>
    Usually they do, and almost always emphasizing content after the last midterm. In the event the course coordinator decides 
    to not cover pre-midterm content, they will say it in class or on the syllabus (usually the former). The latter 
    occurred in CIV214 and CIV280, but did not occur during my first year.
</p>


<h2>Other</h2>

<a name="schedules-released"></a>
<h3>When will our schedules be released? When will I be able to enroll in courses?</h3>
<p>
    If you are going into first year and are not taking APS162 or APS164 this summer, you will not have an elective slot for 
    the upcoming school year. UofT will release your schedule in mid-to-late June. Learn more 
    <a href="https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/academics-registration/enrolment-registration/enrolment-registration-fall-winter-enrolment-registration-guide/">
        here
    </a>.
</p>
<a name="time-courses-run"></a>
<h3>When do courses at UofT Engineering run?</h3>
<p>
    In your first two years of study, core courses will only run from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., with exams sometimes in the evening 
    ending as late as 9 p.m. or on the weekend (though rarely on Sundays). UofT Engineering Exams will be two and a half 
    hours, starting at 9:30 a.m., 1 p.m., or 6:30 p.m. Engineering elective courses or upper-year courses may also run in the 
    evening -- two mandatory third-year courses in Civil Engineering have practicals until 8 p.m.
</p>
<a name="payment-deadline"></a>
<h3>When will I have to pay?</h3>
<p>
    The deadline to pay your fall tuition is in mid-August. If receiving student aid in Canada or the U.S. or 
    a very large scholarship, you will be able to defer your fees. For more information, see 
    <a href="https://www.registrar.utoronto.ca/fees-payments/fee-deferrals/">UofT's fee deferrals page</a>. If a minimum 
    payment is not paid on time, your enrollment for the fall-winter term will be financially cancelled. For more information, 
    see <a href="https://www.registrar.utoronto.ca/fees-payments/payment-deadlines/">UofT's payment deadlines page</a>.
</p>
<a name="osap-scholarship"></a>
<h3>I got a scholarship. Do I have to tell OSAP?</h3>
<p>
    If it was awarded based on merit rather than financial need and your school has not told you in writing they 
    will report it directly to OSAP, <strong>yes</strong>.
