<h1>Frequently Asked Questions about University</h1>
<p>
    Questions will be added to this page as I see fit.
</p>
<h3>When will our schedules be released? When will I be able to enroll in courses?</h3>
<p>
    If you are going into first year and are not taking APS162 or APS164 this summer, you will not have an elective slot for 
    the upcoming school year. UofT will release your schedule in mid-to-late June. Learn more 
    <a href="https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/academics-registration/enrolment-registration/enrolment-registration-fall-winter-enrolment-registration-guide/">
        here
    </a>.
</p>
<h3>When do courses at UofT Engineering run?</h3>
<p>
    In your first two years of study, core courses will only run from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., with exams sometimes in the evening 
    ending as late as 9 p.m. or on the weekend (though rarely on Sundays). UofT Engineering Exams will be two and a half 
    hours, starting at 9:30 a.m., 1 p.m., or 6:30 p.m. Engineering elective courses or upper-year courses may also run in the 
    evening -- two mandatory third-year courses in Civil Engineering have practicals until 8 p.m.
</p>
<h3>When will I have to pay?</h3>
<p>
    The deadline to pay your fall tuition is in mid-August. If receiving student aid in Canada or the U.S. or 
    a very large scholarship, you will be able to defer your fees. For more information, see 
    <a href="https://www.registrar.utoronto.ca/fees-payments/fee-deferrals/">UofT's fee deferrals page</a>. If a minimum 
    payment is not paid on time, your enrollment for the fall-winter term will be financially cancelled. For more information, 
    see <a href="https://www.registrar.utoronto.ca/fees-payments/payment-deadlines/">UofT's payment deadlines page</a>.
</p>
<h3>I got a scholarship. Do I have to tell OSAP?</h3>
<p>
    If it was awarded based on merit rather than financial need and your school has not told you in writing they 
    will report it directly to OSAP, <strong>yes</strong>.
