<h1>Better Late Than Never</h1>

<p>Posted: November 7, 2025</p>
<p>
I first published content to this website at the end of December 2024 and started publishing 
<a href="/projects/">my project progress</a> here the next month. 
As well, I only found a path in transport in March 2024, well into my first year of university 
(though I knew enough of my interest to prefer Civil Engineering over Electrical Engineering the year before). 
Among people I know, this is a rather late moment to find one's true passion and work for it. 
In spite of this, I was still able to get an early Professional Experience Year (PEY) offer this week. 
Let's look at how I think that was possible.
</p>

<h2>Stand Out</h2>

<p>
If you want employers to hire you early, you will need to stand out in some way. 
There are many others who want the same positions as you. 
Exactly what impresses each employer will depend on the employer. 
Some may prefer your group work experience, while some will want more individual work. 
Group experience (particularly when involving an organization) can be a longer-term process, 
though you should still show your ability to do such work. 
If your group work experience currently has nothing to do with your chosen career path, 
put it on your resume and try finding a group you can join soon so you can 
at least show you are getting involved with the field. 
Such groups may allow you to network and find more jobs you were not able to find otherwise.
</p>

<p>
When applying for a job, you want to show competence and interest. 
In doing both, being a higher-up in any organization likely is not necessary 
but showing you can work in a group outside school likely is. 
Even if you have not gone somewhere within your desired path, you can still show some group work competence 
through prior involvement in other places. The other part of competence is the part related to your field. 
In a co-op setting, they are not expecting you to know how to do the job. 
However, experience in the field whether alone or in a group goes a long way. 
<a href="/projects/">My projects</a> were one way to show experience and the company that hired me was impressed with them. 
Exactly what works best for you will depend on your own personal goals and experience, 
but make sure you keep competence and interest in mind. Interest is especially valuable for co-ops, 
and mine felt strongly aligned with the position I have been hired for. Hints that you may be disinterested should be avoided. 
If you have enough time and are unsure of exactly what you want to do, avoid doing multiple of the same kind of project 
unless you realize you are enjoying them.
</p>

<p>
The point of this is to show strong interest in the fields you are interested in, 
which employers will see through your dedication to it outside the classroom, as well as ensuring you are competent 
enough to handle whatever position you are looking to fill.
</p>


<h2>Don't Forget the Standard Job Advice</h2>

<p>
While doing passion projects is gratifying, make sure it aligns well with what co-op employers are looking for. 
If a Civil Engineering student starts making paintings, that will probably not help their co-op applications. 
<a href="/projects/">My projects</a> align well with transportation topics, particularly transportation planning. 
These are places where a Civil Engineering student can get hired, so it would make sense for me to pursue such projects. 
That does not mean you should not have a creative side, but if you can not show its value in your 
chosen career path it will not help your career prospects. If you are pursuing something that will not lead to a 
viable career path or something you do not want to do, you should probably find something else to pursue.
</p>

<p>
Of course, other job advice follows. Prepare for and do well in your interviews 
(my interview with the company which ultimately hired me was the best interview I think I have ever done). 
Write a good cover letter. Et cetera. 
However, make sure you remember what employers are looking for, both the ideas of 
competence and interest as well as what they state in the job posting. 
The company's website follows, as does talking to recruiters. 
I was enticed to apply for the company which ultimately hired me after I talked with their 
recruiter at a career fair about their projects. 
Knowing what the company wants is very important, and knowing what you can provide is very important as well.
</p>


<h2>Do Not Lose Focus</h2>

<p>
It is tempting to look at your lack of time before your next co-op and what you still need to do and assume you are hopeless. 
This is where you should <a href="./mind-your-mindset">mind your mindset</a>. 
You will only make progress if you think you can. I did not realize the true value of 
<a href="../projects/">my projects</a> until a recruiter (whose company ultimately did not hire me) 
mentioned he was looking forward to reading it, then others I knew began talking to me about them. 
You will not know the long-term value of what you are doing until later, so do not assume you are hopeless. 
You will impress your colleagues in the end. Of course, this section does not prevent you from following the standard job 
advice (particularly about ensuring your career path is viable), but your focus should be on making progress, not worrying 
about anything immediate.
</p>


<h2>What if I am Still Unsure?</h2>

<p>
This is a difficult question to answer, exactly how you find your interest may vary. 
For me, it was a combination of a career fair (in March 2024), ideas coming from online discussions, 
and a general desire to fix issues I saw in my daily commute. 
You may not have the same motivators, or the same spaces online, or the same career fairs. 
I recommend you go to career fairs to see if anything there interests you. 
As well, I recommend asking yourself why you chose this path. You like math? What about math interests you? 
What can you see yourself enjoying? That may not be an easy question to answer, 
but I strongly encourage you to find an answer. 
That way, you will at least have some time to build experience like I did.
