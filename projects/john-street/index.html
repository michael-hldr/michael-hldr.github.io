    This study is examining traffic conditions on John Street between Leslie Street and Woodbine Avenue, including all intersections 
    in the study area. The road is four lanes with left- and right-turn lanes at most signalized intersections. 
    Based on site visits conducted in late April and May 2025, John Street appears to operate smoothly 
    during the AM rush hour, with problems only potentially present at Woodbine Avenue and on the left turn lane from 
    southbound Leslie Street to eastbound John Street.<br/><br/>

    Based on site visits in late April and May, traffic problems exist westbound during the PM rush hour. Both turn lanes from 
    westbound John onto Leslie Street were overcapacity at least once when I visited. The left turn lane was overcapacity during 
    most visits during the afternoon rush hour. All other directions appear to be operating smoothly, except turn lanes from 
    eastbound John to Woodbine Avenue.<br/><br/>

    As part of this study, a variety of solutions will be considered. This includes the betterment of alternate modes of 
    transport, such as cycling and public transit. York Region Transit (YRT)'s Route 2 - Milliken is frequently 
    crowded for the westbound trips travelling in the area within the first half of the 5 p.m. hour, and buses have 
    neared capacity during multiple site visits. During a site visit on May 15, 2025, people on the bus were standing 
    right up to the yellow line at the front of the bus. John Street includes a multi-use path on its north side, 
    which connects to a north-south path at Leslie Street. West of there, there is no bike infrastructure on John.<br/><br/>

    Currently, preliminary data is being collected to determine where potential problems throughout the study area may be. Once 
    those are determined, more detailed data will be measured at relevant points in the study area to determine
