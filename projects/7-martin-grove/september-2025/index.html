<p>
    On April 29, 2025, York Region Transit (YRT) modified its Route 7 - Martin Grove to resemble Option 3C of 
    <a href="../">my Winter 2025 study of the route</a>. With a new school year starting, I collected ridership data on all 
    77 weekday trips between September 3 and 11, 2025 to determine what effects the change had on ridership.
</p>
<p>
    Based on my new data, weekday ridership on the route is up nearly 30% since January from approximately 
    1,550 to 2,000 daily passengers. As service increased by 38% in the same time period, the average ridership per 
    trip declined slightly from approximately 28 to 26 causing a slight reduction in crowding. More detailed data:
</p>
<div class="tab">
    <p>
        -AM Peak (before 10:15 a.m.) ridership is up just under 20%<br/>
        -Midday (10:15 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.) ridership is up around 45%. 
        This time of day had the largest service increase (from every 60 minutes to every 32 minutes)<br/>
        -PM Peak (2:30 to 8 p.m.) ridership is up around 30%<br/>
        -The evening sample size was rather small, but ridership increased significantly like at other times.<br/>
        -Southbound ridership increased significantly more than northbound ridership. The difference in ridership between 
        the southbound and northbound directions is now quite small.<br/>
        -The increases in ridership in individual sections was generally too inconsistent to conclude about, but ridership 
        not south of Steeles but going north from stops between Steeles Avenue and Highway 7 remained around 25% of the total 
        passengers.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    Using the same definition of "busy trip" as in the original project (>35 passengers south of or at Steeles Ave.), 
    trips were busy at the following times:
</p>
<div class="tab">
    <p>
        -Northbound, around 6 a.m.<br/>
        -The northbound and southbound trips starting at 7:12 and 7:04 a.m., respectively. These were the most crowded trips 
        I recorded. The higher crowding on these two trips is potentially due to students at Holy Cross Catholic Academy
        and a longer than usual gap from the previous trip due to differences in scheduled running time leading to 
        40-minute gaps at the end of the route.<br/>
        -Northbound, around 1 p.m., 3:30 p.m., and between 4:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.<br/>
        -Southbound, between 4:30 and 5:30 p.m. Several southbound trips were just below the ridership threshold between 2:30 and 7:30 p.m.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    I also noted severe delays (upwards of 10 minutes) occurring during the early morning (before 7 a.m.) and evening 
    (after 8 p.m.) periods. YRT is adjusting the schedule for the route effective November 2, 
    with trips slowed and headways widened during these periods.
</p>
<p>
    The days of the week this data was taken during (compared to in January) is noted below. 
    Percentages do not add to 100% due to rounding.
</p>
<div class="tab">
    <p>
        -27% collected on Mondays (13% in January's data)<br/>
        -6% collected on Tuesdays (36% in January's data)<br/>
        -34% collected on Wednesdays (1% in January's data)<br/>
        -10% collected on Thursdays (13% in January's data)<br/>
        -22% collected on Fridays (36% in January's data)
