<h1>7 - Martin Grove study</h1>
<h4>
    This is not an official study, I am doing it independently.
</h4>
<div class="row">
<div class="column1">
    <p>
        York Region Transit (YRT) Route 7 - Martin Grove runs along Highway 27, Martin Grove Road, 
        and Rutherford Road between Woodbine Centre (a dead mall across the street from Woodbine 
        Racetrack) and Al Palladini C.C. at Rutherford and Islington. 
        This study attempts to determine whether the current weekday routing needs to be truncated 
        or modified. YRT 
        <a href="https://online.flippingbook.com/view/160254622/8/">
        considered truncating the route at Humber College</a> in 2024 
        (<a href="https://archive.is/v8YMY">archived</a>), but 
        ultimately did not implement the change in January 2025.<br/><br/>
        While YRT noted 90 trips are impacted on a typical weekday, how does this impact 
        compare to the passengers who would benefit from the increased service on the rest of the route 
        once it is truncated? What can we use with this info?<br/><br/>
        
        For this reason, I collected ridership data on all trips on the route 
        in January 2025. My sample of approximately 1200 passengers 
        (myself excluded from all data) suggests:<br/><br/>
        -Three and a half percent of passengers travelling on the route to or from Steeles or further south use 
        route 7 to the areas south of Humber College.<br/>
        -On trips I took to Highway 7, around a fifth exclusively travelled north of Steeles. 
        This suggsts the percentage of riders south of Humber College is a bit below three percent.<br/>
        -There is never more than three passengers south of Humber College<br/>
        -Trips are busy, often with 29 or more passengers, during the following periods:<br/>
<div class="tab">
        -Mostly northbound between 5 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. and between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.<br/>
        -Both ways between 6:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. and throughout the afternoon peak period.
</div></p>
<p>
        The high ridership suggests service improvements are warranted (the route presently does 
        not run any more frequently than every 28 minutes at any time). I have not been able 
        to find clear standards from YRT on when they improve service. Looking at the 
        <a href="https://cdn.ttc.ca/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Documents/Home/About-the-TTC/Projects-Landing-Page/Transit-Planning/Service-Standards_May-2024.pdf?rev=6c96a85cc0a64147ad424f949dabce64">
            TTC's standard
        </a>
        , they note that service improvements are warranted when at the busiest hour in the busiest 
        direction, the bus regularly has more 95% of their crowding standard: 
        35 passengers on at once off-peak, and 51 during rush hours (Route 7 uses 12-metre buses).<br/><br/>
        My data indicates that this is the case northbound after 1 p.m.. Assuming a 
        completely uniform timing for when passengers want to ride and no induced demand 
        resulting from better service (both of which will make the bus busier, though 
        to what degree I am not sure), midday service needs to be at least every 44 minutes. 
        Thus, any routing alternative which does not improve service to at least this level 
        will require an additional bus to be alloted. In all cases, ridership should be monitored 
        following any routing change.<br/><br/>

        I have begun looking into routing alternatives in the Humber College area, whether they 
        would improve the route's efficiency and their impacts on passengers.<br/><br/>

<h2>Potential routing options</h2>
<p>
    All service frequencies listed below are under the assumption that no new buses 
    are assigned to the route except as noted above and no changes to the scheduled 
    duration of the unchanged sections of the route occur.
</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="column1">
    <h3>Option 1: Simplify routing south of Humber</h3>
    <p>
        Instead of getting rid of service south of Humber College Terminal, this option 
        reverts the routing to its pre-2020 state with a shorter route to Woodbine Centre. If I 
        determine this option is the best, I will look into whether this area should get weekend service.<br/>
        The service would operate at the following frequencies:<br/><br/>
        Early morning: Every 26 minutes<br/>
        Morning rush hour: Every 32 minutes<br/>
        Midday: Every 37 minutes (one bus added)<br/>
        Afternoon rush hour: Every 32 or 33 minutes<br/>
        Evening: Every 50 minutes<br/><br/>

<div class="column1">
    <h3>Option 2: Remove service south of Humber College</h3>
    <p>
        This option will remove service south of Humber College Terminal, but will allow for a 
        modest service improvement through the reduced trip duration (YRT's figures 
        are the same as mine, except during midday hours):<br/><br/>
        Early morning: Every 23 minutes<br/>
        Morning rush hour: Every 28 minutes<br/>
        Midday: Every 33 minutes (one bus added)<br/>
        Afternoon rush hour: Every 28 minutes<br/>
        Evening: Every 44 minutes<br/>

</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="column1">
    <h3>Option 3: Revise route to Humber College Terminal</h3>
    <p>
        This set of options would remove the route diversion to Humber College Blvd. and 
        Finch Ave. in one or both directions. This would potentially result in another 
        minor service improvement and while 3B and 3D would connect with Etobicoke General 
        Hospital but option 3 may reduce ridership west of Highway 27.<br/><br/>

        Option 3C service would operate approximately at the following levels:<br/><br/>
        Early morning: Every 22 minutes<br/>
        Morning rush hour: Every 27 minutes<br/>
        Midday: Every 31 or 32 minutes (one bus added)<br/>
        Afternoon rush hour: Every 27 minutes<br/>
        Evening: Every 42 minutes<br/>
        <br/><br/>
        Option 3D service would operate about the same as option 3C service, with headways at most 
        a minute longer.
        <br/><br/>

    <div class="column1">
        <h3>Option 4: Remove routing to Humber College Terminal</h3>
        <p>
            This option would end the route at Finch Avenue, requiring passengers near Humber College 
            to transfer to or from Line 6 Finch West to complete their journey. I avoided including 
            an option ending at Steeles as a large percentage of riders board along 
            Martin Grove south of Steeles, particularly at Finch and Albion. Option 4 should not 
            be implemented before Line 6 opens and based on the ridership data I have 
            collected I am doubtful it is the best option.<br/><br/>
    
            Option 4 service would operate approximately at the following levels:<br/><br/>
            Weekdays:<br/>
            Early morning: Every 20 minutes<br/>
            Morning rush hour: Every 25 minutes<br/>
            Midday: Every 40 or 41 minutes<br/>
            Afternoon rush hour: Every 24 or 25 minutes<br/>
            Evening: Every 38 minutes<br/>
            <br/><br/>

            Weekends:<br/>
            Saturday (day): Every 42 minutes<br/>
            Saturday evening: Every 37 minutes<br/>
            Sunday (day): Every 42 minutes<br/>
            <br/><br/>
        </p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>
    With the ridership data now collected, I will analyze the ridership data and look into the 
    impacts of discontinuing the routing south of Humber College Terminal on passengers 
    both north and south of Humber College. I note YRT 
    <a href="https://online.flippingbook.com/view/255630976/124/">conducted an onboard survey</a>
     in 2024, however the sample size was small (24 passengers surveyed). I may also propose more 
     options if I believe the study would benefit from it.
