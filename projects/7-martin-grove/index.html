<h1>7 - Martin Grove study</h1>
<h4>
    This is not an official study, I am doing it independently.
</h4>
<div class="row">
<div class="column1">
    <p>
        York Region Transit (YRT) Route 7 - Martin Grove runs along Highway 27, Martin Grove Road, 
        and Rutherford Road between Woodbine Centre (a dead mall across the street from Woodbine 
        Racetrack) and Al Palladini C.C. at Rutherford and Islington. 
        This study attempts to determine whether the current weekday routing needs to be truncated 
        or modified. YRT 
        <a href="https://online.flippingbook.com/view/160254622/8/">
        considered truncating the route at Humber College</a> in 2024 
        (<a href="https://archive.is/v8YMY">archived</a>), but 
        ultimately did not implement the change in January 2025.<br/><br/>
        While YRT noted 90 trips are impacted on a typical weekday, how does this impact 
        compare to the passengers who would benefit from the increased service on the rest of the route 
        once it is truncated? What can we use with this info?<br/><br/>
        
        For this reason, I collected ridership data on all trips on the route 
        in January 2025. My sample of approximately 1200 passengers 
        (myself excluded from all data) suggests:<br/><br/>
        -Three and a half percent of passengers travelling on the route to or from Steeles or further south use 
        route 7 to the areas south of Humber College.<br/>
        -On trips I took to Highway 7, around a fifth exclusively travelled north of Steeles. 
        This suggsts the percentage of riders south of Humber College is a bit below three percent.<br/>
        -There is never more than three passengers south of Humber College<br/>
        -Trips are busy, often with 29 or more passengers, during the following periods:<br/>
<div class="tab">
        -Mostly northbound between 5 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. and between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.<br/>
        -Both ways between 6:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. and throughout the afternoon peak period.
</div></p>
<p>
        The high ridership suggests service improvements are warranted (the route presently does 
        not run any more frequently than every 28 minutes at any time), which could be acheived by 
        removing the southern section of the route. However, I can not confirm whether the 
        alternative (walking to the 927) is the best idea at this time.<br/><br/>

        I completed collecting ridership data on January 27, 2025. 
        I have begun looking into routing alternatives in the Humber College area, as well as into 
        whether discontinuing the route south of Humber College Terminal 
        would improve the route's performance and how it would impact the 
        people who currently or could potentially use the route.<br/><br/>

<h2>Potential routing options</h2>
<p>
    All service frequencies listed below are under the assumption that no new buses 
    are assigned to the route and no changes to the scheduled duration of the route occur.
</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="column1">
    <h3>Option 1: Simplify routing south of Humber</h3>
    <p>
        Instead of getting rid of service south of Humber College Terminal, this option 
        reverts the routing to its pre-2020 state with a shorter route to Woodbine Centre. If I 
        determine this option is the best, I will look into whether this area should get weekend service.<br/>
        The service would operate at the following frequencies:<br/><br/>
        Early morning: Every 26 minutes<br/>
        Morning rush hour: Every 32 minutes<br/>
        Midday: Every 55 minutes<br/>
        Afternoon rush hour: Every 32 or 33 minutes<br/>
        Evening: Every 50 minutes<br/>
    </p>

<div class="row">
<div class="column1">
    <h3>Option 2: Remove service south of Humber College</h3>
    <p>
        This option will remove service south of Humber College Terminal, but will allow for a 
        modest service improvement through the reduced trip duration (YRT's figures 
        are the same as mine):<br/><br/>
        Early morning: Every 23 minutes<br/>
        Morning rush hour: Every 28 minutes<br/>
        Midday: Every 49 minutes<br/>
        Afternoon rush hour: Every 28 minutes<br/>
        Evening: Every 44 minutes<br/>

</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="column1">
    <h3>Option 3: Revise route to Humber College Terminal</h3>
    <p>
        This set of options would remove the route diversion to Humber College Blvd. and 
        Finch Ave. in one or both directions. This would potentially result in another 
        minor service improvement and while 3B and 3D would connect with Etobicoke General 
        Hospital but option 3 may reduce ridership west of Highway 27.<br/><br/>

        Option 3C service would operate approximately at the following levels:<br/><br/>
        Early morning: Every 22 minutes<br/>
        Morning rush hour: Every 27 minutes<br/>
        Midday: Every 47 minutes<br/>
        Afternoon rush hour: Every 27 minutes<br/>
        Evening: Every 42 or 43 minutes<br/>
        <br/><br/>
        I have not determined the level at which option 3D service would operate.
        <br/><br/>
    </p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
        With the ridership data now collected, I will analyze the ridership data and look into the 
        impacts of discontinuing the routing south of Humber College Terminal on passengers 
        both north and south of Humber College. I note YRT 
        <a href="https://online.flippingbook.com/view/255630976/124/">conducted an onboard survey</a>
         in 2024, however the sample size was small (24 passengers surveyed).
