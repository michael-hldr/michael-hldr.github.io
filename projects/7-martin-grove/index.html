<h1>7 - Martin Grove study</h1>
<h4>
    This is not an official study, I am doing it independently.

    <p>
        YRT Route 7 - Martin Grove runs along Highway 27, Martin Grove Road, and Rutherford Road 
        between Woodbine Centre (a dead mall across the street from Woodbine Racetrack) and Al Palladini
        C.C. at Rutherford and Islington. This study attempts to determine whether the current weekday 
        routing needs to be truncated or modified. YRT 
        <a href="https://online.flippingbook.com/view/160254622/8/">
        considered truncating the route at Humber College</a> in 2024 
        (<a href="https://archive.is/v8YMY">archived</a>), but 
        ultimately did not implement the change in January 2025.<br/><br/>
        While YRT noted 90 trips are impacted on a typical weekday, how does this impact 
        compare to the passengers who would benefit from the increased service on the rest of the route 
        once it is truncated? What can we use with this info?<br/><br/>
        
        For this reason, I have been collecting ridership data on several trips on the route 
        throughout January 2025. As of January 16, 2025, my sample of approximately 430 passengers 
        (myself excluded from all data) mostly counted in both directions during rush hours suggests:<br/><br/>
        -Four to five percent of passengers travelling to Steeles or further south use 
        route 7 to the areas south of Humber College.<br/>
        -There is never more than three passengers south of Humber College<br/>
        -Half of trips have 29 passengers or more at Steeles.<br/><br/>

        The high ridership suggests service improvements are warranted (the route presently does 
        not run any more frequently than every 28 minutes at any time), which could be acheived by 
        removing the southern section of the route. However, I can not confirm whether the 
        alternative (walking to the 927) is the best idea at this time.<br/><br/>
        
        Service improvements may come with smaller changes. The current schedule south of Humber College 
        Bus Terminal is overly generous, 
        with buses running three to eleven minutes faster than scheduled from Woodbine Centre to 
        Humber College Bus Terminal (I have not measured this effect southbound yet). As well, 
        the route could be simplified with buses running directly to Highway 27 from Humber College, 
        which to my understanding was discontinued in 2020 due to since-completed Finch West LRT 
        construction.<br/><br/>

        With my rush-hour data approximately half done, I will continue working to finish it while 
        focusing on off-peak times, when the bus route currently runs approximately every hour. With 
        such data and if I am able to look into passengers' tolerance for walking and transfers, I will 
        be able to make a more informed judgement on the route.
