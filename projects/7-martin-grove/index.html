<h1>7 - Martin Grove study</h1>
<h4>
    This is not an official study. I am doing this independently. If you would like to 
    contribute, please <a href="/contact">contact me</a>. 
    I will provide an update by Friday, January 17, 2025.

<p>
    YRT Route 7 - Martin Grove runs along Highway 27, Martin Grove Road, and Rutherford Road 
    between Woodbine Centre (a dead mall across the street from Woodbine Racetrack) and Al Palladini
    C.C. at Rutherford and Islington. This study attempts to determine whether the current weekday 
    routing needs to be truncated or modified. YRT 
    <a href="https://online.flippingbook.com/view/160254622/8/">
        considered truncating the route at Humber College</a> in 2024 
    (<a href="https://archive.is/v8YMY">archived</a>), but 
    ultimately did not implement the change in January 2025.<br/><br/>
    While YRT noted 90 trips are impacted on a typical weekday, how does this impact 
    compare to the passengers who would benefit from the increased service on the rest of the route 
    once it is truncated?<br/><br/><br/>
