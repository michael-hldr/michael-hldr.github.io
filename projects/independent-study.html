<h1>What do I mean by "Independent Study"?</h1>
<p>
    For the purposes of this website, an independent study of mine is one not commissioned or paid for by any organization 
    involved with what I am studying. That does not mean such an organization will not be studying the same thing as I am, as seen 
    with my project on Major Mackenzie West Terminal (which had changes implemented approximately seven months after my project 
    completed). It also does not mean I will not have influence on any organization whose infrastructure or services I look at. 
    York Region Transit (YRT) planners may find the <a href="./wans">West Aurora Network Study (WANS)</a> and Markham's 
    traffic engineers may find my John Street Study, both underway as of the writing of this page. I would be happy to 
    share these projects with them if I get the opportunity once both projects are more advanced, but that does not mean 
    anyone sanctioned one of my projects, nor does it mean my projects' preferred solutions will be implemented.<br/><br/>

    I encourage outside help on my projects and have contacted my professors for help finding information in the past. 
    If you have anything to say about any of my projects, please 
    <a href="/contact">contact me</a>. By doing so, you may give me an idea I did not think of or give me another valuable 
    perspective.
