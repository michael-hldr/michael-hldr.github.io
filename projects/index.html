    This page lists anything I feel is worth publishing on this site, including course work. 
    The list may expand as I do more projects.

    <h2>Course work</h2>
    In October 2024, I was required to write a design report for the CIV282 
    (Engineering Communication) course. I chose to write mine on potential efficiency improvements 
    to Major Mackenzie West Terminal, such as more direct exits and traffic signal timing changes. 
    While I am not confident in the costs I found while researching, I think it overall is a good 
    overview of ways to potentially improve the existing terminal. You can see the report 
    <a href="/files/Major Mack WT Final Report.pdf">here</a>.
    <br/><br/>
    In January - April 2024, as part of the APS112 (Engineering Strategies & Practice 2) course, my 
    team and I made a design for our client, Professor Jason Bazylak, specifically for his kids' 
    lego play area. Please contact me if you would like the report.
