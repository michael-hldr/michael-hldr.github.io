<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>
    I work on personal projects with the goal of improving my understanding of transportation engineering, 
    planning, and related topics, as well as proposing relevant changes for stakeholders to potentially implement (whether 
    or not they have seen my site).
</p>
<p>
    I am currently working on <a href="./john-street">a traffic study</a> focusing on John Street between Leslie Street 
    and Woodbine Avenue, 
    which will attempt to find a solution to traffic problems along this section of John.<br/><br/>
</p>
<p>
    I am also following up on my <a href="7-martin-grove/september-2025/">Route 7 - Martin Grove</a> and 
    <a href="major-mack-wt/">Major Mackenzie West Terminal</a> studies to determine whether new changes need to be implemented. 
    Data collection was completed during the first half of September 2025 and found a near-30% ridership increase on Route 7 
    and a 25% reduction in exit time at Major Mackenzie West Terminal with no reduction in the uncertainty (how much the 
    exit durations deviate from each other).
</p>
<h2>Summer 2025</h2>
<p>
    From April to August 2025, I worked on the <a href="./wans">West Aurora Network Study (WANS)</a>, 
    a reimagining of the bus network in western Aurora. Early into the study, 
    I found the GO station was running out of parking with no room to expand. 
    With this in mind, I proposed a network throughout the western areas of the Town centering on the station
    with clock-faced headways intended to connect well with GO Train 
    departures. All routes also connect with the Viva blue Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) line and at least one grocery store.
    You can find the final report <a href="./wans/files/wans-report.pdf">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    As an experiment in public consultation, I also published 
    <a href="https://youtu.be/4P2s8Sd_Pw8">a video</a> to YouTube about the project. I plan to continue posting videos 
    about ongoing personal projects in the future.
</p>
<h2>Winter 2025</h2>
<p>
    In early 2025, I <a href="7-martin-grove/">looked into YRT Route 7 - Martin Grove</a>, specifically to determine 
    whether truncating the route at Humber College would be appropriate. YRT 
    <a href="https://online.flippingbook.com/view/160254622/8/">considered this</a> in 2024
    (<a href="https://archive.is/v8YMY">archived</a>), but did not implement the change in January 2025 as originally proposed. 
    It became clear during my analysis of the data that the route's service needed improvement particularly during mid-day hours, 
    enough so that an additional vehicle would need to run during mid-day hours. 
    I completed the final report on April 7, 2025 and it can be found 
    <a href="./7-martin-grove/files/7 - Martin Grove Final Report.pdf">here</a>. Following my solution selection, YRT 
    decided to implement Alternative Option C3 from the study including the added mid-day service. 
    The change resulted in weekday riderhip 
    <a href="./7-martin-grove/september-2025/">increasing by nearly 30 percent </a>
    between January and September 2025.
</p>
<h2>Fall 2024</h2>
<p>
    For my CIV282 (Engineering Communication) course in October 2024, I wrote a design report on potential efficiency 
    improvements 
    to Major Mackenzie West Terminal, such as more direct exits and traffic signal timing changes. 
    While I am not confident in the costs I found while researching and the drawings could have 
    been better (I hadn't learned AutoCAD yet), I think it is a good overview of ways to potentially improve the existing terminal. 
    You can see the report <a href="/files/Major Mack WT Final Report.pdf">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    In late July 2025, the more direct entrance road was modified, allowing buses to use it to exit. The intersection, not 
    designed for two-way traffic, prevents buses from safely turning right during most signal phases (despite the lack of 
    restrictions on doing so nowadays) which prevented the road from reducing the uncertainty in the time it takes them 
    to exit. More information can be found on <a href="./major-mack-wt/">the project page</a>.
</p>
<h2>Early 2024</h2>
<p>
    In January - April 2024, as part of the APS112 (Engineering Strategies & Practice 2) course, my 
    team and I made a design for our client, Professor Jason Bazylak, specifically for his kids' 
    lego play area. Please contact me if you would like the report.
