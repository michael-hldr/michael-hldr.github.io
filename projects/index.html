<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>
    This page lists anything I feel is worth publishing on this site, including course work. 
    The list will expand as I do more projects.<br/><br/>

    I am currently working on <a href="./john-street">a traffic study</a> focusing on John Street between Leslie Street 
    and Woodbine Avenue, 
    which will attempt to find a solution to traffic problems along this section of John.<br/><br/>

    From April to August 2025, I worked on the <a href="./wans">West Aurora Network Study (WANS)</a>, 
    a reimagining of the bus network in Aurora. You can find the final report <a href="./wans/files/wans-report.pdf">here</a>.

    In early 2025, I <a href="7-martin-grove/">looked into YRT Route 7</a>, specifically to determine 
    whether truncating the route at Humber College would be a good idea. YRT 
    <a href="https://online.flippingbook.com/view/160254622/8/">considered this</a> in 2024
    (<a href="https://archive.is/v8YMY">archived</a>), but did not implement the change in January 2025 as originally proposed. 
    I completed the final report on April 7, 2025 and it can be found 
    <a href="./7-martin-grove/files/7 - Martin Grove Final Report.pdf">here</a>. I will conduct a follow-up study in September or 
    January to determine the effects of this change and whether more changes are needed.

<h2>Course work</h2>
<p>
    In October 2024, I was required to write a design report for the CIV282 
    (Engineering Communication) course. I chose to write mine on potential efficiency improvements 
    to Major Mackenzie West Terminal, such as more direct exits and traffic signal timing changes. 
    While I am not confident in the costs I found while researching and the drawings could have 
    been better (I hadn't learned AutoCAD yet), I think it is a good overview of ways to potentially improve the existing terminal. 
    You can see the report <a href="/files/Major Mack WT Final Report.pdf">here</a>.

<p>
    In January - April 2024, as part of the APS112 (Engineering Strategies & Practice 2) course, my 
    team and I made a design for our client, Professor Jason Bazylak, specifically for his kids' 
    lego play area. Please contact me if you would like the report.
