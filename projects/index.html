    This page lists anything I feel is worth publishing on this site, including course work. 
    The list may expand as I do more projects.<br/><br/>
    Starting January 2025, I am looking into YRT Route 7, specifically to determine 
    whether truncating the route at Humber College would be a good idea. YRT 
    <a href="https://online.flippingbook.com/view/160254622/8/">considered this</a> in 2024
    (<a href="https://archive.is/v8YMY">archived</a>), but ultimately did not implement the 
    change in January 2025. While YRT noted 90 trips are impacted on a typical weekday, how does this 
    compare to the passengers who would benefit from the increased service on the rest of the route 
    once it is truncated? I will post updates as I get closer to a conclusion, which may not 
    necessarily be just truncating the route or leaving it as is.

<h2>Course work</h2>
<p>
    In October 2024, I was required to write a design report for the CIV282 
    (Engineering Communication) course. I chose to write mine on potential efficiency improvements 
    to Major Mackenzie West Terminal, such as more direct exits and traffic signal timing changes. 
    While I am not confident in the costs I found while researching and the drawings could have 
    been better, I think it is a good overview of ways to potentially improve the existing terminal. 
    You can see the report <a href="/files/Major Mack WT Final Report.pdf">here</a>.
    <br/><br/>
    In January - April 2024, as part of the APS112 (Engineering Strategies & Practice 2) course, my 
    team and I made a design for our client, Professor Jason Bazylak, specifically for his kids' 
    lego play area. Please contact me if you would like the report.
