<h1>Major Mackenzie West Terminal - Before & After</h1>
<h4>
    This is not an official study, it is entirely <a href="../independent-study.html">independent</a>.
</h4>
<p>
    In September and October 2024, I conducted a short study on 
    <a href="../../files/Major Mack WT Final Report.pdf">Major Mackenzie West Terminal</a> in Vaughan, recommending a change 
    to the exit. In April 2025, York Region Transit (YRT) announced the exit would be modified by converting the one-way 
    Amusement Drive to two-way traffic, with the new lane being bus-only. This allows for a more direct exit at the 
    intersection with Major Mackenzie, but the intersection's signal cycle length remains long. Did this solution reduce the time 
    buses need to exit?
</p>
<p>
    Yes, but not by much. Based on my data, the time buses take to exit dropped by approximately 45 seconds (20-30%), but the 
    variability has continued to remain high due to the long signal cycle length at the Major Mackenzie/Amusement Drive/Wellness 
    Way intersection. The transit signal only activates during a single phase and buses do not turn right during any other times.
</p>
<p>
    With the present intersection designed for Amusement Drive to be a one-way road, the curb radius at the intersection is very 
    small, requiring buses to turn onto one of the further left lanes. A wider curb radius would allow for the bus to turn 
    without disrupting traffic from Wellness Way, potentially allowing for right turns on red (or the signal activating during 
    an additional signal phase). The design and whether another solution would be preferable is undetermined.
</p>
<h2>November 2025 & January 2026 Updates</h2>
<p>
    Presently, there are a few ideas to be considered. As part of my design consideration, I intend to use tools I have 
    learned since the last report's completion (such as AutoCAD) in the design process. This list may be updated if I find 
    any additional ideas for consideration.
</p>
<h3>Preferred Solution: Increase the turning radius of the south-east curb</h3>

    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    Buses exiting the terminal do not turn right on red despite no signs indicating such a movement is prohibited. However, 
    due to the tight (4.85-metre) turning radius the bus must turn to one of the two left lanes rather than 
    the right lane, preventing a safe 
    turn during most of the signal cycle. A 12.5-metre radius like the one shown in the Figure 
    (dimensions in millimetress) would  allow a bus to avoid disrupting all traffic during its turns.
    Allowing the bus to turn right on red (as well as other signal adjustments) will require this remedy.
</p>
<p>
    The ideal turning radius for a bus is unclear. 20 to 30 feet (6.1 to 9.1 metres) 
    <a href="https://bcdcog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7.-Operational-Considerations.pdf">has been suggested</a> 
    for "dense urban streets", but 
    <a href="https://www.dimensions.com/element/single-unit-truck-buses-20-foot-wheelbase-turning-path-radius">others</a> 
    state a minimum 8.6-metre radius. The turning radius should certainly not be lower than this number, but 
    should not be higher than 12.5 metres. The Figure shows the maximum turning radius to be considered.
</p>
<h4>Enabled by Preferred Solution: Lengthen the transit signal phase</h4>
<p>
    The transit signal phase is presently only long enough for two buses to make it through during each cycle. My site visits 
    noted multiple occasions when the signals were unable to accomodate all buses needing to exit. This problem will grow over 
    time as the routes serving the terminal (particularly Route 20 - Jane) run more frequently. The issue also occurs when a 
    bus driver does not start moving once the signal turns green, which I observed at one point while at the terminal.
</p>
<p>
    A longer radius would enable buses to turn onto Major Mackenzie Drive without 
    interfering with traffic turning left from Wellness Way. This would allow the transit signal to remain green 
    during the green phase for traffic exiting Wellness Way (shown above in the Figure).
</p>
<h4>Allow buses to turn left from the bus lane</h4>
<p>
    With the extra time alotted during Wellness Way's green phase, the number of buses the intersection can handle 
    increases greatly. As no traffic from Wellness Way  is allowed to go straight onto Amusement Drive, buses on 
    Routes 6 and 165 could turn left from the exit lane without conflict. To save the time required to exit 
    via the existing circuitous exit, this solution is preferred.
</p>
<h3>Other Solutions Considered</h3>
<h4>The proposed exits from the 2024 report</h4>
<p>
    The bridge may be expensive, but it is more direct than the existing exit. However, this expense may be significantly 
    less worthwhile now given a less expensive, more direct exit was found.
</p>
<p>
    The westbound ramp is, like the bridge, a more expensive solution. The current solution has not improved exit times much, 
    so such a solution may still be worthwhile. However, the removal of the prohibition of right turns on red may reduce the 
    wait at the Major Mackenzie/Wellness Way & Amusement Drive intersection (henceforth referred to as "the intersection").
</p>
<h4>Shorten the Signal Cycle</h4>
<p>
    As noted in the 2024 report, the 150-second signal cycle is very long. However, during my time at the intersection I noticed 
    how the signal's timing prevented traffic problems at the intersection, as traffic would normally get a red light 
    once traffic approaching Jane Street backed up near the intersection. This may indicate the cycle at Jane Street needs to 
    be shortened, but due to the high traffic at that intersection the benefit of such a change is less clear.
</p>
<h4>Lengthen the eastbound exit</h4>
<p>
    Presently, the exit only has room for two buses which themselves can barely fit without partly blocking other buses 
    from entering the terminal. This option would most likely require some new infrastructure, though where the lengthened exit would go is 
    unclear.
</p>
<h4>Convert Coaster Way to two-way Operation</h4>
<p>
    This would allow buses to exit eastbound using the ramp to eastbound Major Mackenzie Drive currently used by drivers, 
    without the need for a new bridge. However, 
    it may disrupt car traffic exiting the park particularly on busy nights.
</p>
<h4>Redesign Coaster Way</h4>
<p>
    This would involve reconstructing the existing Coaster Way to allow buses to exit onto the existing exit ramp to eastbound 
    Major Mackenzie Drive without crossing exiting car traffic. This would require new infrastructure, but it would not require 
    constructing a new bridge.
</p>
<h3>Jane Street BRT Study</h3>
<p>
    This study may be impacted by the existing Jane Street BRT study currently being conducted by the York Region Rapid 
    Transit Corporation (YRRTC). 
    <a href="https://www.yrrtc.ca/PDFs/janestreet/Jane_BRT_TRPAP_Openhouse_Boards_FINAL-web_20250516.pdf">
        The BRT's connection to Major Mackenzie West Terminal
    </a> may impact the recommended exit from this study if the Jane Street study recommends modifications to the 
    existing terminal.
