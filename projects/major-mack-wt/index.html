<h1>Major Mackenzie West Terminal - Before & After</h1>
<h4>
    This is not an official study, it is entirely <a href="../independent-study.html">independent</a>.
</h4>
<p>
    In September and October 2024, I conducted a short study on 
    <a href="../../files/Major Mack WT Final Report.pdf">Major Mackenzie West Terminal</a> in Vaughan, recommending a change 
    to the exit. In April 2025, York Region Transit (YRT) announced the exit would be modified by converting the one-way 
    Amusement Drive to two-way traffic, with the new lane being bus-only. This allows for a more direct exit at the 
    intersection with Major Mackenzie, but the intersection's signal cycle length remains long. Did this solution reduce the time 
    buses need to exit?
</p>
<p>
    Yes, but not by much. Based on my data, the time buses take to exit dropped by approximately 45 seconds (20-30%), but the 
    variability has continued to remain high due to the long signal cycle length at the Major Mackenzie/Amusement Drive/Wellness 
    Way intersection. The transit signal only activates during a single phase and buses do not turn right during any other times.
</p>
<p>
    With the present intersection designed for Amusement Drive to be a one-way road, the curb radius at the intersection is very 
    small, requiring buses to turn onto one of the further left lanes. A wider curb radius would allow for the bus to turn 
    without disrupting traffic from Wellness Way, potentially allowing for right turns on red (or the signal activating during 
    an additional signal phase). The design and whether another solution would be preferable is undetermined.
