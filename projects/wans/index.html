<h1>West Aurora Network Study (WANS)</h1>
<p>
    Presently, transit service in western Aurora suffers from some issues. Outside Yonge and Wellington Streets, there is no 
    service outside of peak hours. The rush hour routes serving other areas do not serve any areas north of Wellington Street, 
    and the one south of Wellington is very circuitous. Based on preliminary data, the vast majority (95% CI: 87 to 96%) of 
    trips on route 32 or 434 not going to Cardinal Carter (outside study area) or G.W. Williams (moving in September) start or 
    end on Yonge, Wellington, or in the Stone Road neighbourhood (the latter making up a minority of these trips). These show that 
    people want to access Yonge and Wellington Streets, which the current route 32 is not optimized for. As well, the data 
    shows approximately one third (95% CI: 26 to 40%) of trips go to the neighbourhood along and near McClellan Way, 
    Henderson Avenue, and Bathurst Street. Transit must continue to serve this neighbourhood's residents well.<br/><br/>

    There may also be parking issues at Aurora GO Station. During a visit in late April 2025, I noted high traffic leaving the 
    parking lot, not helped by the lack of a traffic signal there and Wellington Street narrowing to two lanes at the station. A 
    few pedestrians were sighted crossing Wellington Street while the train was also crossing. This shows non-driver demand to 
    Aurora GO, perhaps demand which is unsatisfied by current YRT routes.<br/><br/>

    Finally, there is a lack of transit service northwest of Wellington and Yonge. How can I determine transit demand from that 
    area? I will attempt to determine this and whether the area needs a route implemented in this study, as with the rest of 
    west Aurora.
