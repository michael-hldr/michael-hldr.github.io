<h1>West Aurora Network Study (WANS)</h1>

    This is not an official study, it is entirely <a href="../independent-study.html">independent</a>.

    The impending relocation of Dr. G.W. Williams Secondary School in Aurora presents an opportunity to rethink where the 
    buses in Aurora run. Presently, transit service in western Aurora suffers from some issues.
    Route 32 - Aurora South is very indirect and appears designed 
    to maximize benefit for students attending the local high schools at their existing locations. 
    With G.W. Williams now further east, this design may no longer be useful for most riders. 
    When thinking of how to make transit better in Aurora, many fundamental questions come up: 
    Where do people want to go? Should trips within Aurora be prioritized, 
    or should we focus on connections with other lines taking residents far beyond Aurora? 
    I will ensure as much of these questions are answered as possible.<br/><br/>
</p>
<h2>Where do Aurorans want to go?</h2>

    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    As noted above, route 32 serving Aurora's southwest quadrant is circuitous despite demand showing this may not be the 
    best design. As part of this study, I rode each trip of routes 32, 428, 429 (within Aurora), and 434 twice to determine 
    where existing transit riders are going. This data was collected from April to June, 2025 (Mostly in April and early June).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Transit riders in west Aurora want to go to places along the area's arterial roads, Yonge and Wellington.</strong> 
    The vast majority (95% CI: 95.5% to 98.9%) of riders went to and/or from destinations along those two streets or a 
    destination they could only access by travelling along an arterial (this includes the Stone Road neighbourhood). Both 
    Wellington and Yonge are popular. Among all riders of the noted routes, most (95% CI: 53% to 63%) got on or off 
    at or within a block of Yonge. This can be attributed to Viva blue and the commercial areas around where route 32 
    crosses Yonge. 
</p>
<p>
    Among the passengers not simply making trips exclusively along Wellington, a majority 
    (95% CI: 51% to 65%) still go to or from there. Wellington has commercial strips just like Yonge but it also 
    has high schools (specifically Aurora HS and St. Maximillian Kolbe CHS), which make up over a third (95% CI: 32% to 44%) 
    of trips starting or ending along Wellington. With that in mind and the complete lack of local trips within 
    neighbourhoods, the network in Aurora must prioritize those going to those streets.
</p>
<p>
    My analysis additionally showed that two thirds of riders (95% CI: 63% to 73%) were counted during the PM rush hour. 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justintfan/">Justin Fan</a> told me this is normal 
    for infrequent routes as people are less in a rush and thus are more willing to wait for a less frequent route.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, my data found a third (95% CI: 28% to 38%) of riders boarded or exited along Henderson Drive away from 
    Yonge or in the McClellan Way neighbourhood. Any new network should continue to provide these passengers with 
    easy access to the destinations they go to most.

<h2 class="clear">Getting more people to take transit</h2>
<div class="column2">

        <img src="./files/go-parking.png" alt="Only 56 parking spaces remain of over 800 in this 
        garage, 26 of which are on the top level." style="width:100%; height:auto">
        <figcaption><p>Parking is often scarce at Aurora GO.</p></figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    Parking at Aurora GO <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/aurora-go-parking-1.7325478">remains scarce</a>. While 
    ridership to Aurora GO is presently not strong, I note few good connections to GO Trains presently and the lack of 
    parking (as well as the lack of space for more parking) means demand for alternative means of travel to Aurora GO is 
    inevitable. The traffic along the section of Wellington between Yonge and the tracks is problematic, with my friend 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-s-gaspari/">Lucas Gaspari</a> having specific problems with 
    the Yonge and Wellington intersection. Further bus ridership to the station and to Yonge can mitigate these traffic 
    problems. As a result, the network I develop must focus both on bringing people to arterial streets and to Aurora GO.
</p>
<p>
    Presently, there is a lack of transit service northwest of Wellington and Yonge. A school special from St. Maximillian Kolbe 
    is scheduled for implementation in September 2026. As well, students from Aurora HS also live in this area as do 
    potential GO and Viva riders. With this in mind, a new service in the area should be proposed. I will provide 
    the options I am considering within the next few days.
</p>
<p>
    While analyzing the ridership, I found a very significant difference between the portions of AM 
    and PM rush hour trips I counted taken by high school students going to their high school. During the AM rush (which already has 
    fewer riders overall), ridership to all high schools makes up less than a fifth (95% CI: 12% to 30%) of trips. 
    By comparison, high schools make around two-fifths of afternoon trips (95% CI: 34% to 46%). Some of this may be 
    due to the convenience of other routes, the difference is so high I consider it being the only reason 
    to be improbable.
</p>
<p>
    If I add the GW Williams and Cardinal Carter trips I filtered out of my data, the difference is still very significant 
    with AM school ridership (95% CI: 26% to 41%) being much lower as a portion of total 
    ridership at that time than PM school ridership (95% CI: 46% to 58%) despite PM ridership being much higher overall.
</p>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p>
    Lucas Gaspari noted to me that the section of Wellington between Yonge and Aurora GO often has traffic problems due to 
    it not being as wide as the rest of Wellington, a lack of turn lanes at Yonge, and the rail crossing activating when 
    a GO Train is simply stopping at Aurora GO from the south. I do not believe fixing these traffic issues is within the 
    study's scope, but the poor traffic on Wellington would increase the desirability of avoiding that section as well as 
    alternate transport for the people who currently drive on Wellington.
</p>

    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    Improving the transit experience for those commuting to Aurora GO is in scope and infrastructure solutions may be 
    just as valuable (if not better) than non-infrastructure solutions. For example, the current routes 32, 33, and 54 stop 
    on the north side of Wellington going westbound with no pedestrian crossing at the station, forcing people to go uphill 
    from Industrial Parkway or cross where no crosswalk exists. As I brought up in 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7335431780583231488/">a recent Linkedin post</a>, the 
    crossing pictured is an example of a potential infrastructure solution which would allow buses to stay on Wellington 
    (providing a more direct Viva blue transfer) while providing good access to Aurora GO to GO passengers.
</p>
<h2 class="clear">Other considerations</h2>
<p>
    After Lucas Gaspari noted narrow lanes on Seaton Drive as described 
    <a href="../../advice/standards-wrong.html">in this post</a>, I measured several local roads in Aurora to check if they 
    had lane widths meeting YRT's 3.3-metre standard. The results are shown below, with red roads being below YRT's 
    standard at present. This does not mean these roads can not be used by a YRT route (as discussed in 
    <a href="../../advice/standards-wrong.html">the aforementioned post</a>), but they should be avoided without a very 
    good reason otherwise.
</p>

<p>
    Yellow roads have no median dividing line and should be used with caution: They are generally local roads and a yellow 
    line could be added if needed (potentially resulting in a below-standard lane width). I will not disqualify any options 
    below standard as YRT is proposing to run a school special on Seaton Drive this September and the line can be 
    moved on some roads (sometimes without removing street parking). However, I will apply a penalty to them when 
    evaluating route alternatives.
</p>
<h2 class="clear">Building a new network</h2>
<p>
    From here, I must figure out a new network. I already have some ideas of how it should look and how that might depend 
    on funding. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justintfan/">Justin Fan</a> has made a few suggestions and I will be 
    considering them. I will be posting some ideas here early this week, with the above and other 
    best practices guiding my analysis of them.
