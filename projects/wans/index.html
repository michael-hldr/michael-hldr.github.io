<h1>West Aurora Network Study (WANS)</h1>

    This is not an official study, it is entirely <a href="../independent-study.html">independent</a>.

<p>
    The impending relocation of Dr. G.W. Williams Secondary School in Aurora presents an opportunity to rethink where the 
    buses in Aurora run. Presently, transit service in western Aurora suffers from some issues.
    Route 32 - Aurora South is very indirect and appears designed 
    to maximize benefit for students attending the local high schools at their existing locations. 
    With G.W. Williams now further east, this design may no longer be useful for most riders. 
    When thinking of how to make transit better in Aurora, many fundamental questions come up: 
    Where do people want to go? Should trips within Aurora be prioritized, 
    or should we focus on connections with other lines taking residents far beyond Aurora? 
    I will ensure as much of these questions are answered as possible.<br/><br/>
</p>
<h2>Where do Aurorans want to go?</h2>
<div class="column2">

        </p></figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    As noted above, route 32 serving Aurora's southwest quadrant is circuitous despite demand showing this may not be the 
    best design. As part of this study, I rode each trip of routes 32, 428, 429 (within Aurora), and 434 twice to determine 
    where existing transit riders are going. This data was collected from April to June, 2025 (Mostly in April and early June).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Transit riders in west Aurora want to go to places along the area's arterial roads, Yonge and Wellington.</strong> 
    The vast majority (95% CI: 95.5% to 98.9%) of riders went to and/or from destinations along those two streets or a 
    destination they could only access by travelling along an arterial (this includes the Stone Road neighbourhood). Both 
    Wellington and Yonge are popular. Among all riders of the noted routes, most (95% CI: 53% to 63%) got on or off 
    at or within a block of Yonge. This can be attributed to Viva blue and the commercial areas around where route 32 
    crosses Yonge. 
</p>
<p>
    Among the passengers not simply making trips exclusively along Wellington, a majority 
    (95% CI: 51% to 65%) still go to or from there. Wellington has commercial strips just like Yonge but it also 
    has high schools (specifically Aurora HS and St. Maximillian Kolbe CHS), which make up over a third (95% CI: 32% to 44%) 
    of trips starting or ending along Wellington. With that in mind and the complete lack of local trips within 
    neighbourhoods, the network in Aurora must prioritize those going to those streets.
</p>
<p>
    My analysis additionally showed that two thirds of riders (95% CI: 63% to 73%) were counted during the PM rush hour. 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justintfan/">Justin Fan</a> told me this is normal 
    for infrequent routes as people are less in a rush and thus are more willing to wait for a less frequent route.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, my data found a third (95% CI: 28% to 38%) of riders boarded or exited along Henderson Drive away from 
    Yonge or in the McClellan Way neighbourhood. Any new network should continue to provide these passengers with 
    easy access to the destinations they go to most.

<h2 class="clear">Getting more people to take transit</h2>
<div class="column2">
    <figure>
        <img src="./files/go-parking.png" alt="Only 56 parking spaces remain of over 800 in this 
        garage, 26 of which are on the top level." style="width:100%; height:auto">
        <figcaption><p>Parking is often scarce at Aurora GO.</p></figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    Parking at Aurora GO <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/aurora-go-parking-1.7325478">remains scarce</a>. While 
    ridership to Aurora GO is presently not strong, I note few good connections to GO Trains presently and the lack of 
    parking (as well as the lack of space for more parking) means demand for alternative means of travel to Aurora GO is 
    inevitable. The traffic along the section of Wellington between Yonge and the tracks is problematic, with my friend 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-s-gaspari/">Lucas Gaspari</a> having specific problems with 
    the Yonge and Wellington intersection. Further bus ridership to the station and to Yonge can mitigate these traffic 
    problems. As a result, the network I develop must focus both on bringing people to arterial streets and to Aurora GO.
</p>
<p>
    Presently, there is a lack of transit service northwest of Wellington and Yonge. A school special from St. Maximillian Kolbe 
    is scheduled for implementation in September 2026. As well, students from Aurora HS also live in this area as do 
    potential GO and Viva riders. With this in mind, a new service in the area should be proposed. I will provide 
    the options I am considering within the next few days.
</p>
<p>
    While analyzing the ridership, I found a very significant difference between the portions of AM 
    and PM rush hour trips I counted taken by high school students going to their high school. During the AM rush (which already has 
    fewer riders overall), ridership to all high schools makes up less than a fifth (95% CI: 12% to 30%) of trips. 
    By comparison, high schools make around two-fifths of afternoon trips (95% CI: 34% to 46%). Some of this may be 
    due to the convenience of other routes, the difference is so high I consider it being the only reason 
    to be improbable.
</p>
<p>
    If I add the GW Williams and Cardinal Carter trips I filtered out of my data, the difference is still very significant 
    with AM school ridership (95% CI: 26% to 41%) being much lower as a portion of total 
    ridership at that time than PM school ridership (95% CI: 46% to 58%) despite PM ridership being much higher overall.
</p>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<div class="column2">

        crossing" style="width:100%; height:auto">

        </p></figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    Lucas Gaspari noted to me that the section of Wellington between Yonge and Aurora GO often has traffic problems due to 
    it not being as wide as the rest of Wellington, a lack of turn lanes at Yonge, and the rail crossing activating when 
    a GO Train is simply stopping at Aurora GO from the south. I do not believe fixing these traffic issues is within the 
    study's scope, but the poor traffic on Wellington would increase the desirability of avoiding that section as well as 
    alternate transport for the people who currently drive on Wellington.
</p>
<p>
    Improving the transit experience for those commuting to Aurora GO is in scope and infrastructure solutions may be 
    just as valuable (if not better) than non-infrastructure solutions. For example, the current routes 32, 33, and 54 stop 
    on the north side of Wellington going westbound with no pedestrian crossing at the station, forcing people to go uphill 
    from Industrial Parkway or cross where no crosswalk exists. As I brought up in 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7335431780583231488/">a recent Linkedin post</a>, the 
    crossing pictured is an example of a potential infrastructure solution which would allow buses to stay on Wellington 
    (providing a more direct Viva blue transfer) while providing good access to Aurora GO to GO passengers.
</p>
<h2 class="clear">Other considerations</h2>
<p>
    After Lucas Gaspari noted narrow lanes on Seaton Drive as described 
    <a href="../../advice/standards-wrong.html">in this post</a>, I measured several local roads in Aurora to check if they 
    had lane widths meeting YRT's 3.3-metre standard. The results are shown below, with red roads being below YRT's 
    standard at present. This does not mean these roads can not be used by a YRT route (as discussed in 
    <a href="../../advice/standards-wrong.html">the aforementioned post</a>), but they should be avoided without a very 
    good reason otherwise.
</p>
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1vmyogYFneEQOODev6pcmr2rUBsgJ5WY&ehbc=2E312F&noprof=1" width="80%" height="480px"></iframe>
<p>
    Yellow roads have no median dividing line and should be used with caution: They are generally local roads and a yellow 
    line could be added if needed (potentially resulting in a below-standard lane width). I will not disqualify any options 
    below standard as YRT is proposing to run a school special on Seaton Drive this September and the line can be 
    moved on some roads (sometimes without removing street parking). However, I will apply a penalty to them when 
    evaluating route alternatives.
</p>
<h2 class="clear">Building a new network</h2>
<p>
    From here, I must figure out a new network. I already have some ideas of how it should look and how that might depend 
    on funding. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justintfan/">Justin Fan</a> has made a few suggestions and I will be 
    considering them. I will be posting some ideas here early this week, with the above and other 
    best practices guiding my analysis of them.
</p>
<h3>If you can not raise the budget</h3>
<p>
    I fully expect YRT to be able to budget more for a change in this area. However, it may be appealing to implement an 
    interim configuration until funding increases which will increase the usefulness of the service. 
    <strong>This configuration is strictly for the interim, it will likely get worse with time.</strong> The map below 
    shows one such configuration, which will allow most 32 trips to connect with GO Trains in the interim with the 
    route running every 59 to 61 minutes. Black sections indicate sections the route would no longer serve.
</p>
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1Yk-NSUVPQF5LFcjbwnb04vU0r8vtiRU&ehbc=2E312F&noprof=1" width="80%" height="480"></iframe>
<h3>Route 33</h3>
<p>
    Presently, route 33 - Wellington-Leslie ends at a seemingly arbitrary location near Aurora HS, a kilometre east of 
    Bathurst (where the suburbs end). The "no budget increase" alternative above would remedy this, but further extensions 
    may improve connectivity. Extending the route via Bathusrt will give residents a faster route to Wellington and extending 
    the route to Seneca King or combining it with a branch of route 88 - Bathurst may improve connectivity with destinations 
    further south beyond just Seneca King.
</p>
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1V17Dz5UL4-MPsBGJ3k2KEolVGNfaj2g&ehbc=2E312F&noprof=1" width="80%" height="480"></iframe>
<p>
    An extension along <strong>Dufferin via Snowball</strong> would offer a more direct route to Seneca, but would miss 
    neighbourhoods near Bathurst and make the 88 connection less direct.
</p>
<p>
    An extension along <strong>Bathurst to Seneca King</strong> would still offer direct service to Seneca, but would also 
    connect residental areas near Bathurst Street and provide a more direct connection with Route 88 - Bathurst, enabling 
    an easier journey to destinations in Vaughan and Richmond Hill.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Combining route 33 and route 88</strong> into a new branch of route 88 would allow for a seamless connection 
    to destinations in Vaughan and Richmond Hill, but would reduce service to Seneca King on route 88 and the new branch 
    will be very long (perhaps operationally challenging) with no natural layover spot known in Aurora.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Ending Route 88 at Aurora GO and running it alongside 33 for a short distance</strong> would prevent excess wait 
    time due to an unnatural layover spot. However, it may be more costly due to an extra service running on the same section 
    of Wellington.
</p>
<h3>Northwest Aurora Route</h3>
<p>
    Northwest Aurora previously had a bus route. However, it was discontinued after the COVID-19 pandemic due to low ridership. 
    Thus, we should try to avoid implementing a similar service (which may have had problems preventing people from using it). 
    I note potential demand to St. Maximillian Kolbe CHS and other places along Wellington, which may make ending the route 
    east of Aurora GO more attractive. Thus, I have included east end alternatives as well.
</p>
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1fsSJAsYMMDFJuWCmPhZzvb2h5qSz6Bw&ehbc=2E312F&noprof=1" width="80%" height="480"></iframe>
<p>
    Much of the central alternatives came from problems with traffic congestion on Wellington or the narrow lanes on many 
    important streets in the neighbourhood. In the west, Aurora Heights Drive was ruled out due to a section with narrow 
    lanes, its lack of a Viva blue connection, and its proximity to Wellington Street (and route 33).
</p>
<h3>Routes 96 and 98</h3>
<p>
    Presently, routes 96 and 98 duplicate each other and partly duplicate Viva blue service along Yonge. As a result, routes 
    96 and 98 are seldom busy in the area. A new niche must be found for them, including the possibility of ending the 96 
    further south. The aforementioned niche may include more local routing. This would work best on the 98 due to the 96's 
    length, though alternatives which truncate the route at Aurora GO would work well with route 96. The alternatives 
    are shown below. Some would replace proposed local routes in an Aurora network.
</p>
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1AHS1gKCzMF5Phi4I1hL4vPo1KE4vBzo&ehbc=2E312F&noprof=1" width="80%" height="480"></iframe>
<h3>Rest of the network</h3>
<p>
    After implementing the northwest route and 33 extension, the next area of interest is the southwest. With the data 
    collected and lack of wide enough lanes on alternative routes, the need for service to remain on Henderson Drive 
    is blatant and for Murray Drive it is near-certain. The existing network runs a single route on both streets. If the 
    budget can only support two or three additional vehicles for this area and route 98 is not run on Murray Drive, I 
    would advise continuing this. Otherwise, you can create a more direct routing to Aurora GO from Henderson Dr. via Allaura Blvd., Edward St., and 
    Industrial Pkwy.
</p>
<p>
    With the current GO schedule running generally every 30 minutes during peak hours, it is important for travellers to have 
    a short transfer from the GO Train to their bus. A more direct route along Henderson take approximately 25 minutes 
    round-trip, short enough for one vehicle to provide 30-minute service. Any bidirectional route along 
    Murray Drive will require two, whether or not it includes Henderson Drive. If no local variant of route 96 or 98 
    runs along Murray Drive and a more direct route along Henderson is preferred, a 
    Murray route would make sense. This route may operate in a loop or bidirectionally. 
    You can see the Henderson and Murray route alternatives in the map below.
</p>

<h2>Where to go from here</h2>
<p>
    With all alternatives established, I will work on evaluating them to determine the best possible route networks for 
    Aurora. When a local route is discontinued outside Aurora, a new one will take its place unless service is clearly 
    duplicated (such as in the case of the 96 and 98).
