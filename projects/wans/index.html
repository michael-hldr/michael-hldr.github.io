<h1>West Aurora Network Study (WANS)</h1>
<p>
    The impending relocation of Dr. G.W. Williams Secondary School in Aurora presents an opportunity to rethink where the 
    buses in Aurora run. Presently, transit service in western Aurora suffers from some issues.
    Route 32 - Aurora South is very indirect and appears designed 
    to maximize benefit for students attending the local high schools at their existing locations. 
    With G.W. Williams gone, this design may no longer be useful for most riders. 
    When thinking of how to make transit better in Aurora, many fundamental questions come up: 
    Where do people want to go? Should trips within Aurora be prioritized, 
    or should we focus on connections with other lines taking residents far beyond Aurora? 
    I will ensure as much of these questions are answered as possible.<br/><br/>

    As noted above, route 32 serving Aurora's southwest quadrant is circuitous despite demand showing this may not be the 
    best design. Based on preliminary data, I note the following:
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
    -The vast majority (95% CI: 87 to 96%) of trips on route 32 or 434 not going to Cardinal Carter (outside study area) or 
    G.W. Williams (moving in September) start or end on Yonge, Wellington, or in the Stone Road neighbourhood 
    (the latter making up a minority of these trips). This shows us that 
    people want to access Yonge and Wellington Streets, which the current route 32 is not optimized for.<br/>
    -Approximately one third (95% CI: 26 to 40%) of trips go to the neighbourhood along and near McClellan Way, 
    Henderson Avenue, and Bathurst Street. Transit must continue to serve this neighbourhood's residents well.
</p>
<p>
    There may also be parking issues at Aurora GO Station. During a visit in late April 2025, I noted high traffic leaving the 
    parking lot, not helped by the lack of a traffic signal there and Wellington Street narrowing to two lanes at the station. A 
    few pedestrians were sighted crossing Wellington Street while the train was also crossing.  
    As well, a site visit around 3 p.m. on a Wednesday in May 2025 showed the parking garage was approximately 95% occupied. 
    This shows high demand to Aurora GO, perhaps demand which is unsatisfied by current YRT routes.<br/><br/>

    Finally, there is a lack of transit service northwest of Wellington and Yonge. How can I determine transit demand from that 
    area? I will attempt to determine this and whether the area needs a route implemented in this study, as with the rest of 
    west Aurora.
