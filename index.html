    I am very interested in making transportation systems and infrastructure more efficient, 
    particualrly for public transportation. I plan on updating this website with notes on 
    some transit data I have been collecting since May 2023, as well as looking into 
    potential improvements to some local transportation infrastructure. This includes some bus 
    terminal modifications inspired by Brampton's Downtown and Gateway Terminals.

    There are many wonderful places you can get to by public transit any day of the week.<br/>
    Pictured above is one of my favourites.
