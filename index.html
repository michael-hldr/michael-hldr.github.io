<h1>I'm Michael Hollander</h1>
<p>Welcome to my website! I am a third-year Civil Engineering student at the University of 
    Toronto. You can contact me <a href="/contact">here</a> or via email at
     michael.hollander@mail.utoronto.ca. If you are coming into engineering, perhaps check out 
     <a href="/advice">my advice page</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If you are interested in what I do, check out 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-hollander-8a89592b8">my Linkedin profile</a> and 
    <a href="/projects">my projects page</a>.
        I am currently the Academic Director at <a href="https://civ.skule.ca">Civ Club</a>, 
        and an Executive Volunteer at <a href="https://www.ut-ite.ca/">UT-ITE</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I will also be working in the Transportation Planning team at <a href="https://www.hdrinc.com/ca">HDR</a> during my 
    Professional Experience Year (PEY).
</p>
<p>
    I am very interested in making transportation systems and infrastructure more efficient, 
    particularly for public transportation. I am working on a few <a href="./projects">projects</a> to explore the different aspects 
    of this and related fields.

<h2>Recent updates & Current projects</h2>
<p>
    Line 6 Finch West opened in early December with a rather negative reception. In its aftermath, I examined how 
    <a href="./more/tsp/"><strong>Transit Signal Priority (TSP)</strong></a> can and can't be used to improve it.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong><a href="./advice/math-contests">math competitions</a></strong> page has been updated with a more 
    recent example showing how bad the cheating problem has become.
</p>
<p>
    New solutions for <strong><a href="./projects/major-mack-wt/">Major Mackenzie West Terminal</a></strong> 
    will be developed in late December and early January.
</p>
<p>
    Traffic data collection for the  
    <strong><a href="./projects/john-street/">John Street Study</a></strong> is currently on hold, as my initial desired method 
    proved impossible.
</p>
<p>
    I have compiled <strong><a href="./more/m4/">my images</a></strong> of the construction of the University of Waterloo's 
    <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/mathematics-4/">Mathematics 4 (M4)</a> building. The page will be updated as construction 
    progresses.

    There are many wonderful places you can get to by public transit any day of the week.<br/>
    Pictured above is one of my favourites.
