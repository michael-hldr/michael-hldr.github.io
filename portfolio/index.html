<h1>Portfolio</h1>

<p>This page is currently in a very early draft stage. I am currently not looking for internship opportunities. This draft is primarily intended for viewing by the CIV382 teaching team, with the four entries and Resume they have expressed interest in reviewing.</p>

<p>I am Michael Hollander, a third-year Civil Engineering student at the University of Toronto. My interests in Civil Engineering are primarily in the fields of Structural Engineering and especially Transportation Engineering and Planning. As a future transportation engineer, I know I need to evaluate and design projects for everyone involved: Users, those in the area, and others impacted by the project. That way, I ensure that any project will bring as many benefits as possible with as few drawbacks as possible. I find a special interest in transportation, particularly improving people's quality of life through improving the quality of their trips and in reducing car dependence where possible by investing in different modes of transport (particularly public transportation). I aspire to work to improve our transportation systems as much as possible as part of my work in the professional world once I complete my degree.</p>

<p>As an ambitious student, I have worked on a few major <a href="/projects/">projects</a> and have developed skills in communication, research, and weighing different priorities as part of those projects. I also have experience with software such as QGIS, Inkscape, AutoCAD, and web development using HTML. While I have only used Inkscape and HTML development for my projects, I am looking to expand the software with which I do projects, including some designs in AutoCAD in late December 2025.</p>

<p>You can find my resume <a href="./resume.pdf">here</a>, though you may also find my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-hollander-8a89592b8/">LinkedIn</a> worth looking at.</p>


<h2>West Aurora Network Study (April-August 2025)</h2>

<div class="column2">

<p>This personal project focused on improving the transit network in the Town of Aurora, Ontario.</p>

<p>Aurora, Ontario presently has an incomplete transit network, 
    with very few neighbourhoods served by any bus route off-peak and many not served at all during peak hours. 
    This present situation encourages residents to drive, including to the GO Train station. 
    The station itself is near its parking capacity, presenting an opportunity for alternative means of 
    accessing the station. With the goals of reducing car dependence and not requiring major infrastructure 
    changes in mind, I looked to improve the area's bus network. Rides on all trips of the existing local 
    route 32 - Aurora South and nearby school special routs found local travellers were near-universally 
    using the bus to access the area's arterial roads or sites along them. 
    This left me with the goals of connecting with the GO Train and arterial roads. 
    As GO Train schedules are clock-faced with typical schedules at the time featuring trains 
    arriving every 30 or 60 minutes, I intended on having the routes operate every 30 minutes 
    to connect well with the train, leading to routes designed to have a round-trip time 5 to 15 minutes 
    less than a multiple of 30 minutes. The proposed network can be found 
    <a href="/projects/wans/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Improving the transit network in Aurora, as in many other towns and cities across Greater Toronto, 
    will improve people's access to work, school, local businesses, and more without needing to expand parking, 
    leading to less congestion and fewer issues finding parking for those who need to drive. 
    Having an impact on people's quality of life through improving their commute motivates my project work. 
    Providing a better, more integrated transit system is one way we can do that.
</p>

<p>
    Transportation planning requires responding to the diverse transportation needs of those in the community, 
    as well as the operation of the system.
    It is a challenge to ensure everyone's needs are met, and such challenges are appealing to try solving. 
    In this project, I initially found a problem with the Town's poor transit network both in coverage and service 
    frequency. As the project progressed, additional major problems were found with how the existing network 
    connected to destinations as well. In my career, I may discover additional problems I was not expecting to 
    need to tackle. Connectivity to GO Transit jumped out as a much more major problem than expected. Learning 
    to quickly integrate those problems into my project to ensure they are solved will ensure my solutions do 
    not suffer from the same major problems others have fallen into.
</p>

<p>
    During this project, I was also working on a literature review (another item in this portfolio). 
    Managing my time for both projects became crucial to ensuring both would succeed and would be completed 
    on time. I also endeavoured to improve my ability to keep people's attention in communicating ideas 
    by beginning to publish videos about projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/4P2s8Sd_Pw8">The video for this project</a> 
    was my first and laid the groundwork for future improvements in my ability to communicate my ideas to the public.

<h2>Gas Flow Through Concrete Containment Structures (Literature Review; May-August 2025)</h2>

</div>

<p>This project was completed as part of a research internship under the supervision of Professor 
    <a href="https://kwon.civmin.utoronto.ca/">Oh-Sung Kwon</a> at the University of Toronto.</p>

<p>Nuclear power has become an increasingly popular, particularly in Ontario 
    as concerns around climate change have pushed the provincial government to abandon 
    most of its fossil fuel power plants. To ensure the plants are safe in the event of a meltdown, 
    containment facilities are built. When these buildings break, surrounding communities will need to 
    understand how much such a disaster would impact them For my Summer 2025 co-op term, 
    I worked as a Summer Student under Professor <a href="https://kwon.civmin.utoronto.ca/">Oh-Sung Kwon</a> 
    looking into leakage through damaged concrete containment structures. 
    As part of this research, Postdoctoral Fellow 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-yager-phd-p-eng-29a0621b2/">Jacob Yager</a> 
    needed me to conduct a literature review on the topic. 
    Conducting this literature review ensured that any new research would build on what is known 
    rather than duplicating it.
</p>

<p>In the report itself, much was found on the relationships between leakage and several different variables. The difference in pressure between the inside and outside, the concrete's strength, wall thickness, the amount of reinforcement, crack characteristics including their thickness and the number of them, temperature, and shear stress have all been found to have impacts on the flow rate of gas out of the containment facility. Many researchers have come up with equations to describe the relationship between the leakage rate and these variables. However, there was comparatively less work done on aerosols, such as those more commonly found in nuclear waste.</p>

<p>While not directly related to the transportation field, this report showed me the value of consulting all sources of information before starting a project. Sometimes, you do not need to spend several months orears solving a problem: You just need to look at what has already been found. It also showed the special value of new discoveries as they would allow future researchers to further advance our knowledge. As well, these new discoveries are made possible by our existing knowledge, showing how new knowledge adds to the possibilities for future research.</p>

<h2>Position Presentation (CIV331; September 2025)</h2>

        <figcaption><p>If there were no fares, would a transit agency be able to handle a sudden ridership increase?
        </p></figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>This CIV331 (Transportation) course project argued for keeping transit fares rather than removing them.</p>

<p>There are many contentious issues within the transportation sector which may have major ramifications on the 
    people who use it. Understanding these issues is important to ensuring my approach to transportation engineering 
    keeps everyone's best interests in mind. One such issue is how we should pay for our transit systems. 
    Working with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-tang-b3748332a/"">Jonathan Tang</a>, 
    I found evidence that fares are an important source of revenue for transit systems which particularly in 
    Toronto should be kept to ensure they remain reliable in the face of changing government priorities.
</p>

<p>The primary arguments I examined involved how transit agencies would get funds following the introduction of a 
    no-fare policy. While the local economy would be boosted by the lack of transit fares, it would not make up for the 
    massive amount of fare money used to run the TTC which is over a billion dollars annually. 
    While the choice of consumers means that the exact amount of money a transit agency can expect is uncertain, 
    even reduced amounts would mean fewer people travelling, meaning reduced income comes at the same time as 
    when service increases would be less necessary. Meanwhile, excess ridership can be better accounted for with 
    the extra fare money generated. Fare-free systems will not be able to accomodate as many additional riders 
    this way as they would not have additional income. As well, governments are much less reliable funders of transit 
    (I know about the cuts in the '90s as well as those in the early 2010s).
</p>

<p>I also examined its effects on low-income individuals. While some may have trouble affording transit, 
    initiatives like the TTC's Fair Pass already exist to help low-income individuals 
    (though these programs could absolutely be improved -- my argument did not preclude any improvement to the 
    existing programs). As well, the affordability matters a lot less when fares are lower 
    (TTC fares are low compared to other Greater Toronto Transit Agencies, and I did not say they need to be raised).
</p>

<p>When making an argument for or against the change, you should have the opposing view in mind. 
    The best decisions are made when one can thoroughly consider opposing views and rebuke them well, 
    or realize the opposing view may be right. In my future practice, I will try my best to consider all points of view 
    and all users to ensure we are truly building and planning the best system: one that is reliable through 
    successive governments with wildly different views and one that everyone can access well. 
    This is especially important for transit, which serves both the most vulnerable as well as the reduction in 
    carbon emissions coming from reduced auto reliance.

<h2>Growth & Sustainability - Alternatives to Gross Domestic Product (GDP; September-October 2025)</h2>

<div class="column2">
    <figure>
        <img src="./files/survey_camp_road.jpg" alt="A gravel road through forest" style="width:100%; height:auto">
        <figcaption><p>This road is a great connector, but also cuts through the environment
        </p></figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>
    This CME368 (Engineering Economics) course project focused on the pitfalls of GDP, an alternative, 
    and how countries can improve their standing in that alternative metric.
</p>

<p>
    How do we measure a country's progess?
    For a long time, that has been using primarily financial metrics such as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 
    However, such metrics obscure other things which can make or break life in that country, 
    or those that can show how sustainable the progress truly is. 
    Within the Engineering Economics course (CME368), 
    I was tasked with examining GDP as an indicator of progress as well as an alternative, 
    the Planetary Pressures–Adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI) and how we as well as specific 
    countries can improve their standing in that metric.
</p>

<p>
    GDP is broadly misinterpreted by society. While a better economy is a great thing to have, 
    it obscures many other things that build a good society and is not related to all economic 
    issues it is believed to account for, such as inflation. These other issues being added 
    would create a much better metric. To solve this problem, I was attracted to the PHDI, 
    which looks at Gross National Income (GNI) adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), 
    life expectancy, mean years of schooling, carbon emissions, and material footprint together 
    to compare countries. I found that wealthy countries perform well, but not as well as in purely economic 
    indicators due to their higher emissions and material footprint. East Asia was used as a case study, 
    and all area nations needed to reduce their carbon footprint.
</p>

<p>
    Critically thinking about measures of progress ensures society is looking at the right 
    metrics when making important policy decisions. As a future engineer, 
    any project decision I make must take that into account as well. A new highway may boost the area's economy, 
    but many may be displaced and carbon emissions from additional people driving would not help. 
    We as a society must take this into account to ensure projects will benefit rather than harm us, 
    and that all benefits and harms are considered for any proposed project.
